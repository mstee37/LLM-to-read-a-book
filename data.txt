Question 1.43

Assume that the random variables XandYare normally dis-
tributed: Xâ¼N(ÂµX,Ï2
X), and Yâ¼N(ÂµY,Ï2
Y). The correlation between X
andYisÏ.H o w c a n y o u c h o o s e c o n s t a n t s aandbsuch that you minimize
the variance of the random variable sum S=aX+bYunder the constraints
that a+b=1 ,0 â¤aâ¤1, and 0 â¤bâ¤1?8

P. Whereabouts on the axle should you sit between x= 0 (right over
the wheel on the gravel) and x= 1 (right over the wheel on the pavement) if you want the most
comfortable ride?â

Answer 1.43

The obvious application is to proportions of a portfolio invested
in risky assets (see Questions 3.19 and 3.20). Make the substitution b=1âa.
Then the variance of the sum is
V(S)=a2Ï2
X+2a(1âa)ÏÏXÏY+( 1 âa)2Ï2
Y.
The ï¬rst-order condition isâV(S)
âa= 0. The partial derivative is:
âV(S)
âa=2 aÏ2
X+2ÏÏXÏYâ4aÏÏ XÏY+2 ( 1 âa)(â1)Ï2
Y
=2/â­râ¬cketleftâig
a(Ï2
Xâ2ÏÏXÏY+Ï2
Y)+ÏÏXÏYâÏ2
Y/â­râ¬cketrightâig
.
Thus, the particular athat satisï¬es the ï¬rst-order condition is
aâ=Ï2
YâÏÏXÏY
(Ï2
Xâ2ÏÏXÏY+Ï2
Y).
We should check the second-order condition
â2V(S)
âa2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
a=aâ>0,
to make sure this is a minimum, not a maximum. This is straightforward:
1
2â2V(S)
âa2=Ï2
Xâ2ÏÏXÏY+Ï2
Y
â¥Ï2
Xâ2(+1) ÏXÏY+Ï2
Y
=( ÏXâÏY)2
â¥0,
and the ï¬rst inequality is strict unless Ï=+ 1 .
In fact, I have solved the unconstrained problemâignoring the constraint 0 â¤
aâ¤1. If aâbreaches the constraints, the constrained solution for ais either 1
or 0, depending upon whether ÏXorÏYis the smaller respectively.43
43Theaâwill breach the constraints if the correlation Ïis large enough or the standard deviations
are disparate enough that eitherÏX
ÏY<ÏorÏY
ÏX<Ï.

Statistics Question

Question 4.47

If the coin in Question 4.46 is biased, is the expected number of
tosses to get âthree of the sameâ going to be greater or less than it was with
the unbiased coin?

Answer 4.47

A bias towards either heads or tails in the coin in Question 4.46
is a bias in favor of âmore of the same.â Given that the stopping rule is âthree
of the same,â the expected number of tosses required to end the game must
decrease in this case.
So, if the probability of a head is one-half, and Tis the number of tosses
required to end the game, E(T)=41
8, and it cannot be higher. If, however, the
probability of a head is two-thirds (or, given symmetry, if it is one-third), the
expected number of tosses to end the game drops to E(T)=1 0 7 / 2 7 â3.96. If
the probability of a head is 3/4 (or, given symmetry, if it is 1/4), the expected
number of tosses to end the game drops to E(T)=4 8 3 / 1 2 8 â3.77. If the
probability of a head is one (or, given symmetry, if it is zero), the expected
number of tosses to end the game drops to E(T)=3 ,a n di tc a n n o tb el o w e r .
