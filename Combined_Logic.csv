alcohol jug, which is then thoroughly mixed. The same modest quantity, Q,
of (now diluted) alcohol is then poured back into the water jug to equalize the
volumes of the jugs at their initial levels.
The initial concentration of alcohol in the alcohol jug equals the initial concen-
tration of water in the water jug (at 100%). What is the relationship between
the ﬁnal concentrations of alcohol in the alcohol jug and water in the water
jug?1",1.1,Answer 1.1,"This question has appeared over and over again. Although simple,
it is rarely answered well. No calculation is required to determine the answer.
If you used anyalgebra whatsoever, stop now, go back, reread the question,
and try again.
When the quantity Qof water is poured into the alcohol jug, the concentration
of alcohol in the alcohol jug becomesV
V+Q.A f t e r m i x i n g a n d p o u r i n g s o m e
back, the concentration of alcohol in the alcohol jug does not change again
(because no new water is added). However, when the diluted alcohol is poured
back into the water jug, the concentration of water in the water jug changes
from 100% toV
V+Q.T h a ti s ,t h eﬁ n a lc o n c e n t r a t i o n sa r ei d e n t i c a l .
How do you see that the ﬁnal concentrations must be identical? Remember,
you do not need any calculations at all. In fact, the only reason for any
calculation is if you also want to ﬁnd out what the ﬁnal concentrations are
(you were not asked this, but if you wish to work it out, your calculations need
not go beyond those of the previous paragraph).
Here is how it works. At the end of the process, both jugs contain the same
volume of ﬂuid as they did at the start. The only way for the concentration
of alcohol (for example) to have changed from 100% is if some alcohol was
displaced by water. Similarly, the only way for the concentration of water to
have changed from 100% is if some water was displaced by alcohol. Volume is
conserved (both total volume and volume in each jug), so all that has happened
is that identical quantities of water and alcohol have traded places (and these
identical quantities are slightly less than Q). By symmetry, the concentrations
of alcohol in the alcohol jug and water in the water jug must be identical. This
ﬁnal result is true no matter how many times you repeat the experiment.
If you are still stuck, here is another way of thinking about it. Imagine a

1,Question 1.10,"/_387 Picture a 10 ×10×10 “macro-cube” ﬂoating in mid-air. The
macro-cube is composed of 1 ×1×1 “micro-cubes,” all glued together. Weather
damage causes the outermost layer of micro-cubes to become loose. This
outermost layer falls to the ground. How many micro-cubes are on the ground?",1.1,Answer 1.10,"The 10 ×10 macro-cube question has been very popular. The most
common mistake is for people to count the number of 1 ×1 micro-cubes on
each face and add them up. Even if you do the mathematics correctly (and
most people do not), you miss the whole point.

path of greatest resistance bears the highest rewards, so read no further unless
you did it a better way.
You must look for structure in a problem that leads you to a simple and speedy
solution. The most structure here is to be found in the macro-cube you start

between their volumes is how many micro-cubes fell.

2,Question 1.11,"/_387 There are two cities, A and B, 1,000 miles apart. You have
3,000 apples at City A, and you want to deliver as many as possible of them
to City B. The only delivery method available is a truck. There are, however,
two problems. The truck can hold at most only 1,000 apples, and if there are
any apples at all in the truck, the hungry dishonest driver will steal and eat
one apple for every mile he drives. What is the maximum number of apples
you can deliver from City A to City B? Note that you are welcome to stop
part way, dump oﬀ some apples, and then come back and pick them up later.",1.11,Answer 1.11,"If not for the ability to stop and dump apples along the way,
you could not deliver any apples at all.12So, the key is to make repeated
trips where you dump apples in a pile at the side of the road and then you
subsequently pick up and deliver apples from that apple dump. For example,
suppose you made three trips where each time you left City A with 1,000
apples and dumped 500 uneaten apples at the 500-mile marker. You would
then have accumulated 1,500 apples at the 500-mile marker and you could
deliver 500 of those to City B (e.g., in one trip of 1,000 apples where 500 are
delivered uneaten, and 500 are left to rot at 500-mile marker).
To ﬁnd the optimal strategy, we must put some bounds on what is sensible.
If you are driving away from City A, or away from an apple dump at the side
of the road, then if there are 1,000 or more apples available, it would never
make sense to leave with fewer than 1,000 apples on the truck. For example,
suppose your very ﬁrst move was to drive away from City A with only 900
apples. Well, no matter where you dump the uneaten balance, you missed
out on giving an extra 100 apples a free ride to that spot, and that must be
suboptimal. So, we should drive away from City A only three times, with
1,000 apples on board each time.
The next question is whether, for any one of these three departures from
City A, we dump the uneaten apples at only one apple dump, or whether we
dump them at more than one location. Suppose on one trip we dump 100
apples at the 100-mile marker, and then the uneaten balance at some later
spot. That cannot be sensible, because again, no matter where you dump the
uneaten balance, you missed out on giving an extra 100 apples a free ride to
that spot. So, we must choose a single dump location for each run.
Could dump locations diﬀer by run? Well, as long as we can get the dump
contents to cumulate to a multiple of 1,000 (see below), they should all be
dumped in the same place. Suppose instead that on the third run we dump
apples beyond the location of the dump from the ﬁrst two runs. Then driving
that odd-lot of apples to a further location unnecessarily burns apples because
it subsequently forces the truck to leave the earlier apple dump with fewer
than 1,000 apples. So, not only must we dump the apples in only one location
on any given trip, but we must dump them at the same location on each trip.
So, where do we dump the apples on the three departures from City A, before
subsequently loading up from that combined dump and carrying them further
on? Well, if we dump them at the k-mile marker, we will end up with a total
12Dumping apples part-way into the journey is akin to the “depoting” of food and supplies that
took place during Antarctic journeys (Scott, 2008).

4,Question 1.13,"/_387 What is the ﬁrst time after 3 pmwhen the hour and minute hands
of a clock are exactly on top of each other?",1.13,Answer 1.13,"I present three diﬀerent solutions: ﬁrst, an approximation that
draws upon the answer to the previous question; second, an exact algebraic
solution; and, third, an exact and slightly more elegant algebraic solution.
FIRST SOLUT ION
An approximate answer is a great place to start.16There are 360◦around the
clock face. The minute hand therefore travels at 6◦per minute. At 3:15 the
minute hand is 7 .5◦behind the hour hand (from the previous answer). To
travel that distance takes 7 .5/6 = 1 .25 minutes. That is, one minute and 15
seconds, or 75 seconds. So, at 3:16:15 the minute hand will arrive where the
hour hand was 75 seconds ago. Of course, the hour hand will have moved ever
so slightly during that 75 seconds. So, maybe you need to wait another, say,
ﬁve seconds until the two hands are perfectly coincident. That would be at
3:16:20. The exact solutions following are less than two seconds away from
this approximate answer.
SECOND SOLUT ION
The question asks the ﬁrst time after 3 pmwhen the hour and minute hands
of a clock are coincident. More generally, we can ask the ﬁrst time after npm
when the hour and minute hands are coincident, for n=1,2,. . . ,11 (we miss
out the 12 because the hands are not coincident after 12 and before 1).
Assume we start at npm,f o ro n eo f n=1,2,. . . ,11. By the time the minute
hand whips around to the non the dial, the hour hand will have moved slowly
on already. When the minute hand ﬁnally catches up with the hour hand, the
hour hand will have moved by a total of θ(n) degrees past the non the dial,
say. The minute hand whips around the dial 12 times faster than the hour
hand. So, while the hour hand covers θ(n) degrees, the minute hand covers
12·θ(n)d e g r e e s .
We can also state that the minute hand must have covered 30 n+θ(n)d e g r e e s .
That is 30 ndegrees to get around to the non the dial, and another θ(n)d e g r e e s
to ﬁnally catch the hour hand. So, we may write 30 n+θ(n)=1 2 ·θ(n), and
thus, θ(n)=3 0 n/11 degrees.17
15There are 2 πradians in a full circle. Thus, 360◦=2πradians; 180◦=πradians; 90◦=π
2
radians; and so on. It is just another way of measuring angles.
16I thank Eoin Healy for suggesting this approximation; any errors are mine.
17It also follows that θ(n)=n·θ(1) for n=1,2,. . . ,11, where θ(1) = 30/11 degrees.

5,Question 1.14,"/_387 There are 100 light bulbs lined up in a row in a long room. Each
bulb has its own switch and is currently switched oﬀ. The room has an entry
door and an exit door. There are 100 stockbrokers lined up outside the entry
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 50 All Rights Reserved Worldwide",1.14,Answer 1.14,"Well now, this looks pretty complicated the ﬁrst time you see it.
However, there is a simple way to ﬁgure it out. If you think about it, you see
that the only brokers who touch the switch for light bulb number 64 are those
whose numbers are divisors of 64.
That is, light bulb number 64 has its state of illumination changed by brokers
whose numbers are factors of 64. That is, brokers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64
ﬂip the switch. Because light bulb 64 is originally oﬀ,i tm u s tb et h a ta f t e r
this odd number of switches it is on. See Answer 1.15 for a closely related but
more general solution technique."
6,Question 1.15,"/_387 Exactly the same set-up as Question 1.14, with a diﬀerent ﬁnal
question: How many of the light bulbs are illuminated after the 100th person
has passed through the room, and which light bulbs are they?",1.15,Answer 1.15,"If you now know the answer to Question 1.14, you should be able
to ﬁgure this one out swiftly. If you have not yet ﬁgured out Question 1.14,
then read no further—solve that one ﬁrst.
The only way for a light bulb to be illuminated after the 100th person has
passed through is if its switch was ﬂipped an odd number of times. The
switch for light bulb number Kgets ﬂipped only by people whose numbers
are factors of K.T h u s ,t h eo n l yl i g h tb u l b si l l u m i n a t e da tt h ec o n c l u s i o na r e
those with a number that has an odd number of factors.

(2,16), and (4 ,8). This means that 32 has an even number of factors, and bulb

7,Question 1.16,"/_387 Your bedroom sock drawer contains eight red socks and 11 blue
socks that are otherwise identical. The light is broken in your bedroom, and
you must select your socks in the dark. What is the minimum number of socks
you need to take out of your drawer and carry into your (well-lit) living room
to guarantee that you have with you at least a matching pair to choose from?",1.16,Answer 1.16,"This is an old favorite. I have tried this out on people and have
received almost all imaginable responses. The answer is three, and it cannot
be anything else. Two socks can be diﬀerent, but a third must match one of
the ﬁrst two—giving a matching pair."
8,Question 1.17,"/_387 Following on from the previous question, can you generalize your
answer to otherwise-identical socks of Ndiﬀerent colors? For example, suppose
you have 50 socks of color 1, 50 socks of color 2, . . . , and 50 socks of color N,
how many socks must you pull from your sock drawer in the dark to guarantee
that you have a matching pair?",1.17,Answer 1.17,"With socks of Ndiﬀerent colors, you must pull ( N+1 ) s o c k s
from the drawer to be sure that you have a matching pair. The argument is
the same as it was for the previous question; Nsocks can be diﬀerent (the
worst-case scenario), but the ( N+1 )stsock must match one of the ﬁrst N
socks—giving a matching pair."
9,Question 1.18,"/_387 Following on from the previous two questions, your bedroom
sock drawer contains 2 red, 4 yellow, 6 purple, 8 brown, 10 white, 12 green,
14 black, 16 blue, 18 gray, and 20 orange socks. It is dark, so you cannot
distinguish between the colors of the otherwise-identical socks. How many
socks do you need to take out of the drawer to guarantee that you have at
least three pairs of socks of the same color?
Story: One of my students was asked to “Describe the best boss you have
ever had. ” Watch out for the opposite question: “Describe the worst boss you
have ever had. ” Your answer may indicate disloyalty to a (former) employer.",1.18,Answer 1.18,"Like the answer to the previous question, ask yourself ﬁrst what is
the worst-case scenario? That is, what is the maximum number of socks you
can select without obtaining the required three matching pairs? Recall that
the counts/colors are 2 red, 4 yellow, 6 purple, 8 brown, 10 white, 12 green,
14 black, 16 blue, 18 gray, and 20 orange socks. You will never be able to get
three-pair of the red or yellow socks because there are too few of them. There
are only eight candidate colors remaining. Thus, the worst-case scenario is
that you select 2 red, 4 yellow, and 5 of each of the remaining eight colors,
giving a total of 46 socks. As soon as you select a 47thsock, however, its color
must match the color of one of the previously selected quintuples in those eight
colors. Thus, you need at least 47 socks to guarantee a matching pair."
10,Question 1.19,"/_387 You and I are to play a competitive game. We shall take it in
turns to call out integers. The ﬁrst person to call out “50” wins. The rules
are as follows:
1. The player who starts must call out an integer between one and 10,
inclusive;
2. A new number called out must exceed the most recent number called by
at least one and by no more than 10. For example, if the ﬁrst player calls
out “nine,” then the range of valid numbers for the opponent is 10 to 19,
inclusive.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 51 All Rights Reserved Worldwide",1.19,Answer 1.19,"You get the answer by working backwards. If I am your opponent,
and I am able to call out “39,” then you cannot reach 50, but I can after you
say whatever you say. So, my goal is to call out “39. ” However, if I am able
to call out “28,” then you cannot get to 39, but I can after you say whatever
you say. So, my goal is to call out “28. ” To get to 28, I need only to be able
to call out “17,” and to do this, I need only to be able to call out “6.”
So, my strategy, as your opponent, is to get onto the series 6, 17, 28, 39, 50 at
whichever point I can. If you get to go ﬁrst, you should call out “6.” As long
as you know the winning numbers and stick to them, you cannot lose. If you
start with anything other than 6, I cannot lose.

11,Question 1.2,"/_387 Fischer and Myron just stepped side-by-side onto a moving es-
calator. They are climbing up the stairs, and counting steps as they climb.
Myron is climbing more quickly than Fischer. Myron climbs three steps in
the time it takes Fischer to climb only two steps. Neither of them skips any
steps. Myron steps oﬀ at the top, having counted 25 steps. He waits at the
top for the slower Fischer, who steps oﬀ having counted only 20 steps. How
many steps are showing on the escalator at any instant?",1.2,Answer 1.2,"I give three successively shorter solutions. The ﬁrst is a hammer-
and-tongs solution that lays everything out in detail. The second is more
elegant, and the third is more elegant still. Each solution brings something
slightly diﬀerent to the table.
FIRST SOLUT ION
LetDbe the number of steps showing on the escalator at any moment ( D

speed of the escalator, in steps per second. Let vMbe Myron’s relative speed

12,Question 1.20,"/_387 You are to open a safe without knowing the combination. Be-
ginning with the dial set at zero, the dial must be turned counter-clockwise to
the ﬁrst combination number, (then clockwise back to zero), and clockwise to
the second combination number, (then counter-clockwise back to zero), and
counter-clockwise again to the third and ﬁnal combination number, whereupon
the door shall immediately spring open; there is no handle or key to turn. The
dial has numbers from zero to 40, and the zero is not one of the combination
numbers.
Without knowing the combination numbers, what is the maximum number of
trials required to open the safe? One trial equals one attempt to dial a full
three-number combination, and you must start again from zero for each trial.

Interview Horror Stories from Recruiters
Reprinted by kind permission of MBA Style Magazine
©1996–2021 MBA Style Magazine, www.mbastyle.com",1.2,Answer 1.20,"Safe-cracking in a ﬁnance interview? Yes indeed. The naive an-
swer is that there are 40 possible numbers for the ﬁrst combination, 40 for the
second, and 40 for the third. It would then take at most 403possible trials
to get the safe open. That is 64,000 trials. There are two factors that reduce
this number considerably. The ﬁrst you should have ﬁgured out; the second
you are excused.
The ﬁrst factor is that although three numbers are required to open the safe,
you need only ﬁnd the ﬁrst two of them. If you dial the ﬁrst two numbers
correctly, then you need only turn the dial until the safe pops open. You do
not need to know the last number. This gives 402possible combinations. That
is only 1,600 trials. For extra safe-cracking advice along these lines see Gleick
(1993, pp. 189–190).18
The interviewer in this case suggested a second factor, as follows (and I think it
is a little unfair to any interviewee who is inexperienced in safe-cracking). The
safe is a mechanical device designed with a particular tolerance for inaccuracy.
If the ﬁrst combination number is 14, then dialing either 13, 14, or 15 suﬃces.
This tolerance for inaccuracy brings you down to roughly/p⎬renleft⎜ig
40
3/p⎬renright⎜ig2trials. This
is fewer than 200 trials.
One reader suggested that because you need only ﬁnd a sequence of numbers,
diﬀerent attempts could overlap with other attempts, to reduce the number of
trials needed. If you need to start again at zero every time, however, then this
approach fails. In practice, with real safes, you need to dial clockwise three
times past zero to 75, counter-clockwise two times past zero to 50, clockwise
once past zero to 25, or something like that. So, you need to start anew each
time."
13,Question 1.21,"(**) You are given a set of scales and 90 coins (this question is
similar to Question 1.6). The scales are of the old balance variety. That is, a
small dish hangs from each end of a rod that is balanced in the middle. The
device enables you to conclude either that the contents of the dishes weigh
the same or that the dish that falls lower has heavier contents than the other.
You must pay $100 every time you use the scales.
The 90 coins appear to be identical. In fact, 89 of them are identical, and one
is of a diﬀerent weight. Your task is to identify the unusual coin and to discard
it while minimizing the maximum possible cost of weighing.3What is your
algorithm to complete this task? What is the most it can cost to identify the
unusual coin (assuming your strategy minimizes the maximum possible cost)?
Note that the unusual coin may be heavier than the others, or it may be
lighter. You are asked to both identify it and determine whether it is heavy
or light.4",1.21,Answer 1.21,"To minimize the maximum possible cost of weighing, your strategy
must use the scales as few times as possible, wherever the location of the “bad”
coin. From Answer 1.6, you know that you need three weighings to ﬁnd a bad
coin in a group of 12. You have 90 coins, so it must take at least four weighings.
However, by the same argument, if you had 144 coins (12 groups of 12), you
could identify a bad group of 12 in three weighings and then the bad coin in
another three. So, (because 90 is less than 144) it should take no more than
six weighings—either four, ﬁve, or six weighings.
In fact, it takes only ﬁve weighings (and at most $500) to both ﬁnd the bad
coin and identify it as heavy or light. I present two quite diﬀerent solution
techniques plus a third quasi-solution: the ﬁrst is an ingenious “hammer-
and-tongs” technique, the second is slightly more structured, and the third
generalizes the second but applies only in special cases. In each case, it takes
only ﬁve weighings to both ﬁnd the bad coin and identify it as heavy or light.

soon-to-be-published book “Genius. ” He talked about genius in general and Richard P. Feynman
in particular. Feynman was an interesting guy, and this is a good book about him.

meter (i.e., 100 centimeters) long and oriented to point north–south. The
ants are of very small size and mass. Each ant walks at a steady pace of
one centimeter per second in a straight line parallel to the long edge of the
ruler. Their initial direction is randomly either north or south. The ants are
all from the same colony and possess an inherited vision problem: they have
peripheral vision only. This means that they can collide with each other if
they meet head on (although very small, they are large enough to collide). If
two ants do collide head on, however, then they each turn around instantly
and head back the way they came at their steady pace. With so many ants in
one small space, a single ant may experience multiple collisions before it walks
oﬀ of the ruler. So, how long must you wait to be sure that all the ants have
walked oﬀ of the ruler?",1.23,Answer 1.23,"After 100 seconds you can be sure that the ants have all walked
oﬀ the ruler. The answer is the same as if the ants had perfect vision. The
key is that if two ants who collide, immediately about face and continue, then
each member of any colliding pair eﬀectively exchanges its exit route with the
other; the ants are fungible. It is just as if one of the colliding pair crawled
over the other and they both kept going without pause.

16,Question 1.24,"/_387 You start with a single lily pad sitting on an otherwise empty
pond. You are told that the surface area of the lily pad doubles every day
and that it will take 30 days for the single lily pad to cover the surface of the
pond.6
If instead of one lily pad you start with eight lily pads (each identical in
characteristics to the original single lily pad), how many days will it take for
the surface of the pond to become covered?",1.24,Answer 1.24,"If you can ﬁgure out the correct relationship between the eight
lily pads and the single one, you get the answer. If you do not have it yet, or
you think it is 3.75 days, then you should stop reading now, and go back and
try again. I am serious; this is a nice question, and you lose a great deal by
peeking at the answers to help you out.
The naive answer is that it takes30
8=3.75 days. This is, of course, incorrect.
The lily pads in the question all grow at the same rate. This means that you
may think of the eight lily pads as being equivalent to one big lily pad. Indeed,
when the single lily pad is three days old, it has the same area as the eight
lily pads do at time zero. This means that you may think of the eight lily
pads as a single lily pad that is three days old. It takes another 27 days for a
three-day-old single lily pad to cover the pond, so it also takes 27 days for the
eight lily pads to cover the pond.
The interviewee suggested that I use 3,000 days instead of 30 days as the time
it takes for the single lily pad to cover the pond. The idea was to make the
question more confusing. The problem with this is that, no matter how small
the initial lily pad (assuming it is visible to the naked eye), it will cover the
surface of the Earth within 100 days and the entire solar system not long
after. Within 3,000 days, the universe will be blotted out—such is the power
of compound growth."
17,Question 1.25,"/_387 Another lily pad problem. There are 27 lily pads on a pond.
Each of the lily pads is one square foot in area. The pond is 6,000 square feet
in area. Each lily pad doubles its size every day. How long until the pond is
covered in lily pads?",1.25,Answer 1.25,"You use the same idea as in the previous lily pad question. Each
pad needs to cover6,000
27square feet to choke the pond. The size of each
pad is 2Nafter Ndays, so you need to solve:6,000
27=2N.T h e s o l u t i o n i s

Without a calculator, you can still do it in your head. You calculate6,000

approximately 200. You know that 28is 256, which exceeds 200; whereas 27
is 128, which falls short, so eight days should do the trick."

tative type of person. ” Interviewee: (conﬁdently, after a slight pause) “Yes

Most people stumble a little. Do not memorize all the possible sixteenths
before your interview—you have worse things to worry about (much worse).
Add or subtract one-sixteenth to get the requested fraction into quarters or
eighths and then compensate for your adjustment.
You should remember that1

19,Question 1.27,"/_387 A snail is climbing up a 10-foot pole. It climbs up by three feet

When does it reach the top of the pole?

(Holland [1973, p. 5]).
6The student who was asked this question says that his interviewer used the number 30. However,
he suggested that I use the number 3,000 to make it more complicated. What is wrong with saying
that it takes 3,000 days for the lily pad to cover the pond?
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 53 All Rights Reserved Worldwide",1.27,Answer 1.27,"This is a common question. The naive answer is that the snail
climbs a net of two feet per day, so it reaches the 10-foot mark at the end of
the ﬁfth day. However, on the morning of the ﬁfth day, the snail starts out
at the eight-foot mark (having slid down from the nine-foot mark overnight).
Two-thirds of the way through the ﬁfth day, the snail reaches the 10-foot mark
and stops because there is no pole left to climb.

you can invite any three dead people (presumably resurrected), who would
you choose? Please do not choose any relatives.” Give it some thought."
20,Question 1.28,"/_387 A windowless room contains three identical light ﬁxtures, each
containing an identical light bulb. Each light ﬁxture is connected to one of
three switches outside of the room. Each bulb is switched oﬀ at present. You
are outside the room, and the door is closed. You may ﬂip any of the external
switches in any manner you choose. After this, you must take your hands oﬀ
the switches and then you may go into the room and do as you please (but
you will not be allowed to damage anything or touch the switches again). How
can you tell which switch goes to which light?",1.28,Answer 1.28,"Here are two answers.29
1. Turn Switch #1 on. Wait a while. Then turn it oﬀ while simultaneously
turning Switch #2 on. Go into the room. The illuminated light corre-
sponds to Switch #2. The warm non-illuminated bulb corresponds to
Switch #1. The cold non-illuminated bulb corresponds to Switch #3.
2. Guess. You have a one-in-six chance if they are random. However, light
switches are not usually random. If you assume the switches are phys-
ically located in an order that relates to the physical placement of the
bulbs (as they usually are), then you have a ﬁfty-ﬁfty chance!"
21,Question 1.29,"/_387 Inside of a dark closet are ﬁve hats: three blue and two red.
Three smart men go into the closet, and each selects a hat in the dark and
places it unseen upon his head. Each man knows both that the closet con-
tains three blue hats and two red and that the other two men have the same
knowledge.
Once outside the closet, no man can see his own hat. The ﬁrst man looks
at the other two, thinks, and says, “I cannot tell what color my hat is.” The
second man hears this, looks at the other two, and says, “I cannot tell what
color my hat is either. ” The third man is blind. The blind man says, “Well, I
know what color my hat is.” What color is his hat, and how does he know?",1.29,Answer 1.29,"The only way the ﬁrst man can know the color of his own hat is if
he sees the other two wearing red hats—of which there are only two. However,
the ﬁrst man does notknow his hat color, so the other two must be wearing
either both blue or one red and one blue. The second man, upon hearing the
ﬁrst, knows then that he and the third man are either both wearing blue hats,
or one wears a red hat, and one a blue. If he still does not know what color
hat he is wearing, it must be because the third man is wearing a blue hat.
Why? Well, if the third man wears red, then that pinpoints his own hat as
blue since this is the only option left from the choice of either both blue or
one red and one blue. Since the second man does not know his hat color, then
the third man must be wearing blue. The third man, upon hearing the ﬁrst
two, deduces that his own hat is blue via the same reasoning."

24,Question 1.31,"/_387 There are two motorcyclists on a single lane road. They are 25
miles apart. At a signal, they start moving toward each other with constant
speeds. The ﬁrst motorcyclist rides at 20 mph; the second rides at 30 mph.
When the signal goes oﬀ, a ﬂy on the helmet of the ﬁrst motorcyclist is startled
and starts ﬂying toward the second motorcyclist at 40 mph. When the ﬂy
reaches the second motorcyclist (now moving toward the ﬁrst), he immediately
reverses course and ﬂies back to the ﬁrst motorcyclist. When the ﬂy gets back
to the ﬁrst motorcyclist, he reverses course again. The ﬂy continues to ﬂy
backwards and forwards between the two motorcyclists until they all collide.
How many miles will the ﬂy have traveled before his life is extinguished?",1.31,Answer 1.31,"This is easier than it sounds. You do not need any inﬁnite sums,
and, if you used them, go back and try again before reading on. For every two
miles covered by the ﬁrst motorcyclist, the second covers three miles. Two plus
three is ﬁve, and there are ﬁve multiples of ﬁve between them. This means
they will meet after the ﬁrst has traveled 10 miles and the second 15. We
know that the ﬂy moves at twice the speed of the ﬁrst motorcyclist, so it must
cover 20 miles before its miserable life ends.
Many other solutions exist. Here is one I liked.31The second motorcyclist is
approaching the ﬁrst at a relative speed of 20 + 30 = 50 miles per hour. With
25 miles between them, they will collide after one-half of an hour. Meanwhile,

occurs with probability: P(/uniontextN

pool, what happens to the water level in the pool?
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 55 All Rights Reserved Worldwide",1.39,Answer 1.39,"First of all, “very small” is classic physics slang for very, very small
(i.e., so small that it is a pinpoint mass). If the rock is tossed overboard, the
water level falls as though water equal in mass to the mass of the rock is being
sucked out of the pool. The rock forces the boat to displace the rock’s mass
of water. After the rock is gone, the boat rises up, and the water level falls
down (Archimedes’ Principle).40
The next time you are washing dishes, try this experiment. With the sink
half-full of water, ﬂoat a drinking glass. Now drop a steel ball bearing gently
into the glass. The glass sinks down, displacing a mass of water equal in mass
to the mass of the ball bearing, and the water level rises. Now pluck the ball
bearing from the glass, using a magnet. The reverse happens, the glass rises,
and the water level falls as though water equal in mass to the mass of the ball
bearing is being sucked out of the sink.
How does your answer change if the rock is replaced by a piece of pumice
(i.e., ﬂoating volcanic glass), or by a 100lb ice cube, or by a tethered helium
balloon (to be set free, tether and all)?"

34,Question 1.40,"(**) In a certain matriarchal town, the women all believe in an
old prophecy that says there will come a time when a stranger will visit the
town and announce whether any of the men folk are cheating on their wives.
The stranger will simply say “yes” or “no,” without announcing the number
of men implicated or their identities. If the stranger arrives and makes his
announcement, the women know that they must follow a particular rule: If
on any day following the stranger’s announcement a women deduces that her
husband is not faithful to her, she must kick him out into the street at 10 am
the next day. This action is immediately observable by every resident in the
town. It is well known that each wife is already observant enough to know
whether any man (except her own husband) is cheating on his wife. However,
no woman can reveal that information to any other. A cheating husband is
also assumed to remain silent about his inﬁdelity.
The time comes, and a stranger arrives. He announces that there are cheating
men in the town. On the morning of the tenth day following the stranger’s
arrival, some unfaithful men are kicked out into the street for the ﬁrst time.
How many of them are there?",1.4,Answer 1.40,"The answer involves both mathematical induction and game the-
oretic arguments. If there is exactly one cheating man in the town, Mr. C, say,
then every wife except Mrs. C knows who he is. Not only that, but Mrs. C
is unaware of any cheats—the stranger’s announcement comes as a shock to
her. Immediately after the stranger’s announcement, Mrs. C asks: “Who can
be cheating if I have seen no cheats?” The only possible answer is it is Mr. C.
Come the next morning, his happy days are over, and out he goes.
Suppose instead that there are exactly two cheating men in town: Mr. C1 and
Mr. C2. In this case, Mrs. C1 knows there is one cheat in town (Mr. C2), and
Mrs. C2 knows there is one cheat in town (Mr. C1)—the stranger’s announce-
ment comes as no shock to either woman. Each thinks there is only one cheat

35,Question 1.41,"/_387 In front of you are three poles. One pole is stacked with 64 rings

What is the minimum number of moves you need to make to achieve the task?
Story: Here are some Fermi problems from Section 5.5: “How many Mc-
Donald’s fast food outlets are there in the U.S.? How many gas stations are
there in the U.S.? How many elevators are there in the U.S.?”",1.41,Answer 1.41,"This is known as the Towers of Hanoi problem. If you are peeking
here for a solution, then go back and think about mathematical induction.
LetV(n)d e n o t et h em i n i m u mn u m b e ro fm o v e sn e e d e df o r nrings. I assert
that V(n)=2n−1, for all positive integers n(I will justify this shortly). The
proof uses mathematical induction.
Case n=1 : With one ring, it certainly takes exactly one move. My assertion
is thus true for the case n=1 .
Case n = N: Suppose that my assertion is true for n = N, and consider the
case n = N + 1. By assumption, it takes V (N)=2N ?1 moves to get the first
N rings to pole #2. Use one additional move to get ring #(N + 1) to pole #3.
Now use V (N)=2N ? 1 moves to move the N rings on pole #2 to pole #3.
The total number of moves used is 2V (N) + 1 = 2(2N ? 1) + 1 = 2(N+1) ? 1.
However, this is just V (N + 1). That is, if my assertion is true for n = N, it
is also true for n = (N + 1).
The result follows, because I showed my assertion is true for n = 1, and I
showed that if my assertion is true for n = N, then it is also true for n = N +1.
In particular, because I showed the assertion to be true for n = 1, it follows
that it must be true for n = 2. It then follows that because the assertion is
true for n = 2, it is also true for n = 3, ... and so on, up to ?.
41
With n = 64 rings, it takes V (64) = 264 ? 1 = 18, 446, 744, 073, 709, 551, 615
moves. At one move per second, it would take you 584.5 billion (i.e., 584.5
thousand million) years to complete this task. The Earth will fall into the Sun
in less than one-hundredth of this time period."

thinking for a minute. “The eldest is dyslexic,” says John. How old are the
children?",1.51,Answer 1.51,"The numbers used and the situation described may diﬀer from
question to question, but the general solution technique is always the same.
Factor the product into all possible triplets: (1,2,18), (1,3,12), (1,4,9), (1,6,6),
(2,2,9), (2,3,6), and (3,3,4). Which one is it? Well, Mary knows the sum,
and these potential triplets sum to 21,16,14,13,13,11, and 10, respectively.
Knowing the sum was not suﬃcient for Mary to pin down the triplet, so it
must be a triplet with a non-unique sum: 13 in this case. This cuts down the
candidates to (1,6,6) and (2,2,9). John says the eldest is dyslexic, so there
must be an eldest (ignoring rubbish answers like one twin is 20 minutes older
than the other). That just leaves (2,2,9)."

49,Question 1.54,"/_387 We are to play a game on a table in the next room. We each
have an inﬁnite bag of identical quarters (i.e., American 25-cent pieces). We
will take it in turns to put one quarter on the table. Quarters may not overlap
on the table. When there is no room left on the table to put another quarter,
the winner is the last person to put a quarter on the table. Let me tell you that
there does exist a strategy for winning and that this strategy is independent
of the size of the table.
1. What is the shape of the table?
2. Do you start?
3. What is your strategy for winning?
4. Is there any case where this does not work?",1.54,Answer 1.54,"You win if you can place the last coin on the table and leave no
space for me to place a further coin. A necessary condition is that the table be
radially symmetric. That is, there must exist a central point on the table (at
its center of mass if the table is of uniform density and thickness) such that any
line drawn upon the table passing through this central point is evenly bisected
at this central point. Simple examples are a square, an ellipse, a rectangle, a
circular disc, etc.
You should play ﬁrst and place your ﬁrst quarter at the center of the table.
You should make subsequent moves by imitating me: Place your quarter in the
mirror image of my position when viewed looking through the central point.
This ensures victory because if I can still place a coin on the table, then so
can you.55
Although radial symmetry is necessary, it is not suﬃcient. The strategy does
not necessarily work if the table is a regular shape but not a simply-connected
one; for example, an annulus.56If the table is an annulus and the hole in the
middle is bigger than a quarter, then the only change to your winning strategy
is that you should let me go ﬁrst.
Story: A student of mine was asked “How would you value yourself?” That
is, put a dollar ﬁgure on your value using discounted cash ﬂow analysis."
50,Question 1.55,"/_387 You have a chessboard (8 ×8) plus a big box of dominoes (each
2×1). I use a marker pen to put an “X” in the squares at coordinates (1,1)
and (8,8)—a pair of diagonally opposing corners. Is it possible to cover the
remaining 62 squares using the dominoes without any of them sticking out
over the edge of the board and without any of them overlapping? You must
not damage the board or the dominoes in the process or do anything weird
like standing them on their ends—just answer the question.10
9Similarly, you could see questions on integrals (or derivatives) of sin θ, cos θ, tan θ, cot θ, and
cosec θ.
10Naoki Sato has suggested a follow-up question. Place an “X” on two squares: one black, and
one white. Can you cover the remaining squares with dominoes? See Answer 1.55 for the solution.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 58 All Rights Reserved Worldwide",1.55,Answer 1.55,"No, you deﬁnitely cannot tile the 62 squares with the dominoes.
If you cannot see why, then go back and think again before reading on.
55I thank Tim Hoel and Victor H. Lin for this elegant solution technique.
56An “annulus” is a disc with a hole in the center—like a musical compact disc, for example.
An annulus is path connected (any two points may be joined by a line), and is therefore connected
(it cannot be split into two non-empty non-intersecting open sets), but it is not simply connected
(which requires path-connectivity and that any loop may be shrunk continuously within the set).

51,Question 1.56,"(***) You have 52 playing cards (26 red, 26 black). You draw
cards one by one. A red card pays you a dollar. A black one ﬁnes you a
dollar. You can stop any time you want. Cards are not returned to the deck
after being drawn. What is the optimal stopping rule in terms of maximizing
expected payoﬀ? Also, what is the expected payoﬀ following this optimal
rule?11",1.56,Answer 1.56,"Deciphering the optimal strategy is analogous to locating an opti-
mal stock price exercise boundary for an American-style option. Calculating
the expected payoﬀ to the game, assuming the optimal strategy, is analogous
to valuing an American-style option. Like valuing an American option, you
have to work backward through a decision tree, calculating the expected pay-
oﬀs to proceeding versus stopping at each node. For two, four, six, and eight
cards, the expected payoﬀ to the game is $1

if any, remaining in the deck, assuming optimal play. With randbcards
remaining, denote this additional expected value as E(r, b). Thus, the value
of the game is V(r, b)=( R−r)−(B−b)+E(r, b). Simple logic dictates that
57An alternative solution has been suggested to me by Aidong Chen. Let each square on the
board be described by its coordinates ( x, y) for 1 ≤x, y≤8. Any domino covers two adjacent
squares, either ( x, y) and ( x, y+ 1), or ( x, y) and ( x+1,y). If we add those coordinates up, we
get 2 x+2y+ 1 in either case. To tile the 62 remaining squares requires 31 dominoes. If we add
up 31 coordinate sums, each of form 2 x+2y+ 1, we must get an odd number. If we add up the
coordinate sums of the 62 remaining squares, however, we must get an even number (because the
sum of the coordinate sums of all 64 squares is even by symmetry, and the two corners to subtract,
(1,1) and (8,8), have even sums). So, it cannot be done.

52,Question 1.57,"One of my students interviewed with some folks who “wanted to
get an idea of his comfort with formulae and with explaining things to clients. ”
They asked why it is that if pis a prime number greater than 3, then p2−1
is always divisible by 24 with no remainder.",1.57,Answer 1.57,"A prime number has no factors other than itself and 1. Thus, 4
is not prime because it has factors: (1,4), and (2,2). Drawing a number line
might be a good way to explain this to an interviewer. I will just use words.
1. A prime p bigger than 2 cannot be an integer multiple of 2, else it would
not be prime. Thus, a prime bigger than 2 must be odd. Thus, p ? 1 is
even. Thus, p ? 1=2n for some positive integer n. Thus, p = 2n + 1.
2. A prime p bigger than 3 cannot be an integer multiple of 3, else it would
not be prime. However, draw a number line and it must be that either
p ? 1 or p + 1 (but not both) is a multiple of 3. That is, p is 1 away from
a multiple of 3, but we do not know in which direction. Thus, p1=3m
for some positive integer m, where  means exactly one of + or ?, but
not both. Thus, p = 3m  1.
3. The question asks about p2?1. From #1 we see that p2?1=4n2+ 4n =
4n(n + 1). One of n or n + 1 must be even, and with that 4 there, we see
that p2 ? 1 contains a factor of 8 (i.e., 2  2  2).
4. From #2, we see that p2 ? 1=9m2  6m = 3m(m  2). Thus, p2 ? 1
contains 3 as a factor.
5. If we picture p2 ? 1 factored out into all possible numbers of smallest possible size, then the results from #3 and #4 cannot overlap. That is,
p2?1 contains factors of 222 and 3; thus, p2?1 is an integer multiple
of 24."

The two ﬁzzing sparking ﬂames are going to burn toward each other and meet.
When they meet 60 seconds worth of fuse has been burnt in two sections that

of the old balance variety. That is, a small dish hangs from each end of a rod
that is balanced in the middle ( /_554). The device enables you to conclude either
that the contents of the dishes weigh the same or that the dish that falls lower
has heavier contents than the other.
The 12 marbles appear to be identical. In fact, 11 of them are identical, and
one is of a diﬀerent weight. Your task is to identify the unusual marble and
discard it. You are allowed to use the scales three times if you wish, but no
more. Note that the unusual marble may be heavier than the others, or it
may be lighter; you do not know which. You are asked to both identify it and
determine whether it is heavy or light.",1.6,Answer 1.6,"This challenging question has been very popular. Sometimes it is
balls, sometimes marbles, sometimes coins. I present two solutions.3
FIRST SOLUT ION4
Let me write, say, 1Hif marble 1 is heavy or potentially heavy (it should be
clear by the context), but if it cannot be light. Similarly, let me write 1Lif
marble 1 is light or potentially light, but if it cannot be heavy. Using this
notation, the 12 marbles yield 24 diﬀerent possible outcomes, because each
marble may be heavy or light, relative to its peers:
1H 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H 10H 11H 12H
1L 2L 3L 4L 5L 6L 7L 8L 9L 10L 11L 12L.
Split the 12 marbles into three groups: Let these be, say, marbles 1–4, marbles
5–8, and marbles 9–12. Compare marbles {1234 }(in the ﬁrst dish) with
marbles {5678 }(in the second dish). There are three cases, as follows.
Case 1: The ﬁrst dish is heavy. In this case, we have reduced the 24 possible
outcomes to only eight possible outcomes, as indicated:
1H 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H 10H 11H 12H
1L 2L 3L 4L 5L 6L 7L 8L 9L 10L 11L 12L.
3One of my readers, who tried this at home, said that the methods given here, while successful
in theory, would not work in practice. He said he would need to add the use of a marker pen to
the problem statement to keep track of which marble was which when swapping marbles between
the dishes on the balance.

Your Perspective, No Rotations: Put your wristwatch on your left wrist

bearing arm is pointing the same direction as yours. Your wristwatch is to
the left of your head, and your reﬂected self’s wristwatch is also to your left
of his or her head. There has been no ﬂipping of left for right. Similarly, if

or smaller than the sum of the areas of the medium and small pizzas. The
area of a circle is proportional to the square of the diameter. So, let L,M,a n d

of each pizza and lay the three halves on the table so that the corners touch
and the three diameters form a triangle. If the angle in the corner where the
small and medium pizzas touch is a right angle (check it using one corner of
the pizza box!), then L2=M2+S2holds by Pythagoras’ Theorem and the
two orders are equally attractive. If the angle is larger than a right angle, then
L2>M2+S2and the large pizza is the better deal. If the angle is smaller
than a right angle, then L2<M2+S2and the small pizza plus medium pizza
is the better deal. We could alternatively use a single slice from each pizza
(with side length equal to the radius of the circle) and form a triangle of side
lengths."

At what speed does it hit the ground, and how long does it take to get there?",1.72,Answer 1.72,"Let us use the standard high school physics equations for linear
motion with constant acceleration. There are, however, two good reasons for
having a sensible guess before doing any math. First, if our calculations give
an answer that is wildly diﬀerent from our guess, then we have some baseline
ﬁgure for suspecting we may have made an error in the math. Second, if you
start with a guess, it may be that your interviewer will hold up a hand and say
“OK, ﬁne, let’s move to the next question.” He or she may just have wanted
to get an estimate out of you to see if you can estimate anything. They may
not be interested at all in whether you remember simple equations of motion.
So, I would say “Well, I can estimate it using equations for linear motion with
constant acceleration, but ﬁrst let me guess that it is something like ...ﬁve
seconds and 100 miles per hour” (or whatever your guess is).
Now, if we have to go on to the math, I would tell the interviewer that these
equations of motion ignore air resistance, and any updraft caused by wind hit-
ting the building. The penny may in fact reach “terminal velocity” (i.e., when
drag from the air resistance produces an upward force that perfectly counters
the force of gravity, and the penny stops accelerating). Even if it does not
reach terminal velocity, my estimate of speed will be an upper bound only

73,Question 1.77,"/_387 You are seated at a table that has 100 quarters on it. You are
told that there are 10 heads and 90 tails turned up. Unfortunately, the room
is pitch black (or you are blindfolded) and you cannot see the quarters. You
also cannot tell by touch which way up they are. So, how can you divide them
into two piles so that you have the same number of heads in each pile?",1.77,Answer 1.77,"If you ask, your interviewer will conﬁrm that he or she expects an
exact solution and not some estimate, that you are allowed to ﬂip any coin if
you wish, and that the two piles need not have the same number of coins in
each. Now go back and try again before peeking any further.
You know the total number of heads in the 100 coins is equal to 10. So,
suppose you form one pile of Ncoins, and one pile of 100 −Ncoins. Let us
assume that there are Hheads and N−Htails in the ﬁrst pile (but you do
not know H).
Thus there are 10 −Hheads in the second pile and 90 −(N−H) tails in the
second pile. How can you get the number of heads in each pile to be the same?
Well, you cannot balance Hand 10 −Hbecause you don’t (and can’t) know
what His.
What do you know? You know you can ﬂip any coin. What if you ﬂipped
every coin in one pile? There is, after all, some sort of constrained symmetry
going on here. Let’s say you ﬂip every coin in the ﬁrst pile. Then you have
N−Hheads in the ﬁrst pile. Can you choose Nso that the number of heads
in each pile is the same in that case, that is, N−H=1 0 −H?Y e s , c l e a r l y
choosing N=1 0d o e st h ej o b .
So, all you have to do is split the coins into a pile of 10 coins and a pile of
90 coins, and then ﬂip every coin in the pile of 10 coins. If you had chosen
instead to ﬂip every coin in the second pile (i.e., the pile of 100 −Ncoins),
the algebra would have yielded exactly the same solution (you should check
that).
If you get mixed up in the interview, just plug some numbers in. For example,
suppose you start oﬀ with 3 heads and 7 tails, say, in the pile of 10 coins,
then you must have 7 heads and 83 tails in the pile of 90 coins. You can see
immediately that ﬂipping every coin in the pile of 10 coins will give 7 heads
in each pile.
In practice, of course, you don’t know how many heads are in each pile, just
that they are the same number. You might even end up with zero heads in
each pile if you happened to initially move all 10 heads into the pile of 10
coins.
If the interviewer had asked instead for the same number of tails in each pile,
you would form a pile of 10 coins and a pile of 90 coins, and ﬂip every coin in

proach uses a simple Monte-Carlo simulation. The second uses the Leibniz
formula. Other techniques exist.
FIRST SOLUT ION
Simulate pairs of random variables ( x, y), each distributed uniform on the
unit interval [0 ,1]. These pairs, when plotted in two dimensions, populate
a unit square. A circle with unit diameter may be inscribed within the
unit square. I just need to count what proportion of points ( x, y)s a t i s f y

1= π/4. So, just multiply the relative proportion of
points within the circle by four. Even with sample size only 1,000,000, the
answer is generally accurate to within a tenth of a percentage point (i.e., ﬁrst
two decimal places correct).
SECOND SOLUT ION
The famous Leibniz formula for πis given in Equation A.20.63
π

n=0(−1)n
2n+1(A.20)
Cutting oﬀ Equation A.20 at n=1 0,000 yields an approximation accurate to
three decimal places (i.e., 3.14169264359053). Cutting it oﬀ at n= 10,000,000
is accurate to six decimal places (i.e., 3.14159275358978). Convergence is a
little slow.
Note, however, that the partial sums in Leibniz’s approximation (like many
numerical techniques for pricing options) bounces up and down as nincreases,
alternately overestimating and then underestimating π/4. Like acceleration
techniques for pricing options, using the average of two successive estimates
will therefore improve accuracy (Crack, 2021). So, let B(N)=4 ·/summ⎬tiontextN

Then with N=1 0 ,000, [ B(N)+B(N−1)]/2 = 3 .14159264859028 ,which is
accurate to seven decimal places, or eight if you round. With N=1 0,000,000,
[B(N)+B(N−1)]/2 = 3 .14159265358979, which is accurate to 14 decimal
places."
75,Question 1.79,"There are 12 people sitting around a perfectly round table that
is marked out to look like the dial of an analog clock. The host is sitting at
12 oclock, and 11 guests are sitting at each hour from 1 oclock to 11 oclock,
respectively. (In fact, the original question did not mention a clock, but I
think it makes for a clear mental image.) The host holds a prize. He will
pass the prize to someone seated next to him. Then that person will pass it
to someone seated next to him, and so on. The host, or any guest, is equally
likely to pass the prize clockwise or counter-clockwise. The last guest to touch
the prize wins it. (That is, the 11th guest to lay hands upon the prize gets to
keep it.) Which hour of the clock should you sit at to have the highest chance
of winning the prize?",1.79,Answer 1.79,"The short answer is that sitting in any position from 1 oclock to
11 oclock is equally likely to win the prize, with probability p = 1/11 for each
seat. If you are peeking here for hints, go back now and think again.
The setup of this problem is known as a random walk on a circle. The solution
overlaps with the gamblers ruin problem. So, I will describe how someone
seated at the table can win, in terms of the random walk on a circle, and then
I will remind you of the gamblers ruin problem, and use its solution to solve
our problem.
Assume you are seated at the i
th hour of the clock-table, for some 1 ? i ? 11.
Now imagine an arc painted on the outer edge of the clock-table, where the
arc records who has been visited by the prize as it is passed around. This
arc begins as a single blob of paint at the 12 oclock position, but grows in
clockwise or counter-clockwise jumps as the prize is passed around. In order
for you, seated at the i
th hour, to win the prize, every other guest has to touch
it before you. In order for this to happen, two specific events must happen.
First, the arc that records who has touched the prize so far must jump to
a person sitting next to you at either the (i ? 1)th or (i + 1)th hour. (Note
that we are counting modulo-12 here, with no zero. So, in the case i = 1,
i ? 1 = 12 and the arc is already touching the (i ? 1)th hour.) Indeed, the
game cannot conclude unless a person next to you touches the prize; this
happens with probability unity. Given the symmetry of the argument that is
about to follow, we can, without loss of generality, assume that the arc reaches
the (i + 1)th hour before it reaches the (i ? 1)th hour.
Second, if the arc has reached the (i + 1)th hour before it reaches the (i ? 1)th
hour (e.g., you are sitting at four oclock, and the prize arrives at five oclock,
not yet having arrived at three oclock), then in order for you to win the prize,
the prize must walk right around the clock again, and reach the (i ? 1)th hour
(three oclock in my example) without landing in your hands in the interim.
No matter what happens next, you know that you have won the game if the
prize walks its way a net of 10 seats clockwise from the (i + 1)th hour without
ever backtracking far enough to land in your hands. Another way to say this
is that if we count the net clockwise progress of the prize from the (i + 1)th
hour, this net balance must reach 10 hours before it reaches ?1 hours (note
that reaching ?1 hours is not needed for the game to conclude). We can now
use a gamblers ruin argument to find the probability of this event.
Suppose that you are a gambler with $10 in your hand. Your opponent has $1
in his hand. A fair coin is tossed repeatedly. If it is heads, you gain a dollar
from your opponent, and if it is tails you lose a dollar to your opponent. If your
wealth reaches $11 (i.e., your net balance increases by $1 and your opponent
is ruined), then the game stops and you win. If, however, your wealth reaches
$0 (i.e., your net balance drops by $10 and you are ruined), then the game
stops and your opponent wins.
The probability that you are ruined in this gamble is the same as the probability that your opponents wealth steps up by a net change of $10, never having
reached a net change of ?$1. Given that the advance-decline probabilities are
the same in both games (i.e., 50-50), the probability of your ruin is the same as the probability of the prize walking a net of 10 hours clockwise, never having
walked a net of ?1 hours. So, if we can find the probability of your gambling
ruin, we have the answer to our clock-table game.
Consider a more general gamblers ruin problem. You have $n in your pocket
(in our case, $n = 10). Your opponent has $m in his pocket (in our case,
$m = 1). A fair coin is tossed repeatedly. If it is heads, you gain a dollar from
your opponent, and if it is tails you lose a dollar to your opponent. The game
continues until one of the players is ruined. Let P(i) be the probability that a
player with $i in his hand is ultimately ruined playing exactly this game, for
0 ? i ? n + m.
Now consider some intermediary balance $i where 1 ? i ? n + m ? 1. There
is half a chance that the next coin toss is favorable, and there is half a chance
that the next coin toss is unfavorable. So, by the total probability theorem,
we have Equation A.21.64
P(i) = P(ruin|favorable coin toss)  P(favorable coin toss) +
P(ruin|unfavorable coin toss)  P(unfavorable coin toss)
= P(i + 1) 
1
2 + P(i ? 1) 
1
2 (A.21)
Multiplying Equation A.21 through by 2 and rearranging, we get the secondorder recurrence in Equation A.22.
P(i + 1) ? 2P(i) + P(i ? 1) = 0, for 1 ? i ? n + m ? 1 (A.22)
To solve a second-order recurrence, we need two boundary conditions. In our
case, P(0) = 1 (you are already ruined), and P(n+m) = 0 (you already won).
The (homogeneous) characteristic equation for the recurrence in Equation A.22
is given by Equation A.23.
?2 ? 2? + 1 = 0 (A.23)
This quadratic equation has repeated characteristic roots at ?0 = 1. So, we
are looking for solutions of the form given in Equation A.24.65
P(i) = A  1i + B  i  1i = A + B  i (A.24)
Plugging the boundary conditions into Equation A.24, we quickly deduce that
A = 1 and B = ?1/(n + m). It follows that the probability of ruin is given
by Equation A.25.
P(i) = n + m ? i
n + m (A.25)
Back to our clock-table game, we plug i = 10, n = 10 and m = 1 into
Equation A.25 to find that the probability of ruin (and of winning the clocktable game) is given by p = 1/11 , as expected. More generally, for g guests
seated around a circular table, the probability that any guest wins the prize
is equally likely and given by p = 1/g ."
76,Question 1.8,"/_387 Interviewer: “You are a bug sitting in one corner of a cubic room.
You wish to walk (no ﬂying) to the extreme opposite corner (the one farthest
from you). Describe the shortest path that you can walk. Be sure to mention
direction, length, and so on.”",1.8,Answer 1.8,"You (the bug) cannot ﬂy; you have to walk. You must ﬁnd the
shortest path from corner to corner.
In any world, the shortest path between two points is called a “geodesic. ” On
a spherical world (e.g., the Earth’s surface), a geodesic is an arc of a “great
circle. ” A great circle is a circle on the surface of the sphere with diameter
equal to the diameter of the sphere. For example, airplanes typically follow
great circles above the Earth (because it is the shortest path and, therefore,
the most fuel-eﬃcient path).
Like a spherical world, the cubic-room world has a two dimensional surface.
However, the lack of curvature in the cubic-room world means that the shortest
distance between two points must be a straight line rather than an arc of a
great circle (in a world without curvature, geodesics are straight lines).
If the cubic room is opened up and ﬂattened out it can be seen that the shortest
path is a straight line from one corner to the other. In the un-ﬂattened room,
this straight line corresponds to two line segments that meet exactly halfway
up one wall-ﬂoor or wall-wall boundary. Direct computation using Pythagoras’
Theorem10reveals that the total path length is√
5u n i t s .
10In this case, the path is the hypotenuse of a triangle of side lengths 2 and 1 in the ﬂattened-out
room or two hypotenuses of triangles each of side lengths 1 and1
2in the un-ﬂattened room. In
either case, the path is of total length√

All the above assumes that the matrix be symmetric (if real-valued) or Her-
mitian (if complex valued). The deﬁnition of a positive deﬁnite matrix
can, however, be generalized to non-symmetric and non-Hermitian matrices
(mathworld.wolfram.com ). In that case, the deﬁnition is applied only to the
symmetric part or Hermition part of the matrix, respectively.66
What about portfolio theory applications, theoretical and otherwise? In prac-
tice, portfolio optimization tools often assume that the VCV matrix is positive
deﬁnite (Kwan, 2010). For example, to obtain the standard Markowitz frontier
assuming short selling, you need that the variance-covariance (VCV) matrix
be invertible (Crack, 2020b). A positive deﬁnite matrix is invertible, but a
positive semi-deﬁnite matrix might have a zero eigenvalue, and therefore be
non-invertible.

let us look at several techniques. Then we will discuss which one is computa-
tionally easiest without using pre-canned routines.
First, I would like to use Sylvester’s criterion , but we need to review
some terms. A sub-matrix obtained by deleting the ithrow and the jthcolumn
of an n×nmatrix is an ( n−1)×(n−1) matrix. The determinant of this
sub-matrix is called a minor (or, more fully, a minor determinant of order
n−1), and is sometimes denoted Mi,j.I f a n y t w o r o w s {i1,i2}and any two
columns {j1,j2}are deleted, then the determinant of the resulting sub-matrix
is a minor of order n−2, denoted Mi1,i2,j1,j2,a n ds oo n . I ft h en u m b e r i n g
of the deleted row(s) is identical to the numbering of the deleted column(s),
then the determinant of the resulting sub-matrix is a principal minor (of order
k,w h e r e n−krows and the same n−kcolumns have been deleted). The
determinants of the upper-left sub-matrices, in particular, are known as the
“leading principal minors” (Ayers, 1962).
So, for example, for a 5 ×5m a t r i x ,d e l e t i n gt h eﬁ r s tr o wa n dt h eﬁ f t hc o l u m n
produces a sub-matrix whose determinant, M1,5,i sam i n o r . I ti sn o t ,h o w e v e r ,
a principal minor, leading or otherwise. Deleting the second row and the sec-
ond column of the original matrix produces a sub-matrix whose determinant,
M2,2, is a principal minor, but it is not a leading principal minor. Finally,
deleting rows k:5a n dc o l u m n s k:5 ,f o ra n y k∈{2,3,4,5}produces a sub-

80,Question 1.83,"Three random variables have equal pairwise correlation ρ. What
is the possible range of ρ?",1.83,Answer 1.83,"At ﬁrst glance, this sounds like a statistics question. I put it in this
chapter, however, because it follows naturally from the previous two questions
about matrices and their properties. I discuss two solution techniques. The
ﬁrst uses Sylvester’s criterion, and the second uses eigenvalues.
FIRST SOLUT ION
We have that the correlation matrix, C, of the three random variables, is given
by Equation A.43.
C=⎛
⎜⎝1ρρ
ρ1ρ
ρρ 1⎞
⎟⎠ (A.43)
Before hitting this problem over the head with any deep analysis, ask yourself
what values of ρare possible in Equation A.43. Well, ρ=0i sp e r f e c t l y
feasible, because that is what we would get if the three random variables
were statistically independent of each other. Also, ρ=1i sp e r f e c t l yf e a s i b l e ,

correlated with each other. For example, if the three random variables are

may be interpreted as a probability-weighted average of values of g(X), where
X∼N(µ, σ2). A Monte-Carlo simulation does not discretize the domain of

of large numbers.

86,Question 1.89,"/_387 There are three wooden barrels in the market. One contains
apples only, one contains oranges only, and one contains both apples and
oranges. Labels to this eﬀect are pinned to the barrels, but the labels have
been mixed up so that no label correctly identiﬁes the contents of the barrel
to which it is pinned. You can see the labels, but you cannot see inside, or feel
inside, or smell inside, any barrel. You may ask for as many pieces of fruit as
you want from any of the labeled barrels. What is the minimum number of
pieces of fruit you can request, and from which barrel(s) should you request
them, if your task is to re-pin the labels so that each label correctly identiﬁes
the contents of its barrel?14",1.89,Answer 1.89,"You need only ask for a single piece of fruit to deduce the correct
labeling. If you are peeking here for a hint, then go back and ask yourself how
it can be done with only a single piece of fruit.
Given the symmetry of the problem, my initial instinct was that asking for
fruit from the barrel labeled “Apples,” or the one labeled “Oranges,” was not
going to solve the problem.
If you ask for a single piece of fruit from the barrel labeled “Apples and
Oranges,” then, given the mis-labeling, you know that every other piece of
fruit in that barrel is the same as the piece you requested. So, suppose you are
handed an apple from this barrel. Then, you have located the true “Apples”
barrel, currently labeled “Apples and Oranges. ” Given that you now know
where the true “Apples” barrel is, then you now know that the barrel labeled
“Oranges” cannot be the true “Apples” barrel. By construction, however, the
barrel labeled “Oranges” also cannot be the true “Oranges” barrel (because
every barrel is mis-labeled). Therefore, the barrel labeled “Oranges” must be
the true “Apples and Oranges” barrel (there is no other choice remaining).
Thus, we deduce that the remaining barrel, labeled “Apples,” must be the
true “Oranges” barrel.
Another way to think about the problem is that once you have identiﬁed that
the barrel labeled “Apples and Oranges” contains only apples, then you can
unpin the “Apples” label from its barrel, remove the “Apples and Oranges”
label, and pin the “Apples” label in its correct place. This leaves you with a
correctly labeled “Apples” barrel, an unlabeled barrel, an incorrectly labeled
“Oranges” barrel, and the “Apples and Oranges” label in your hand. You
know that the “Oranges” label has to move, and that the unlabeled barrel is
the only place to pin it. So, having done that, you can then pin the “Apples
and Oranges” label on the remaining barrel.
Of course, if at the initial step you are instead handed an orange from the
barrel labeled “Apples and Oranges,” then the argument is analogous (i.e., the

87,Question 1.9,"/_387 A mythical city contains 100,000 married couples but no children.
Each family wishes to “continue the male line,” but they do not wish to over-
populate. So, each family has one baby per annum until the arrival of the ﬁrst
boy. For example, if (at some future date) a family has ﬁve children, then it
must be either that they are all girls, and another child is planned, or that
there are four girls and one boy, and no more children are planned. Assume
that children are equally likely to be born male or female.

2More generally, what is the sum of the integers from 1 to n?
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 49 All Rights Reserved Worldwide",1.9,Answer 1.9,"People tend to overlook the brilliantly simple situation described.
If you did any mathematics whatsoever, you probably missed the point.
No calculation is needed to see that at each stage an equal number of male
babies and female babies are expected to be born. The proportions of male
and female children are, therefore, expected to remain equal at 50%.
Still stuck? Here are the details (standing at t=0a n dl o o k i n ga te x p e c t e d
outcomes only): by the end of the ﬁrst year, the 100,000 families have 50,000
boys and 50,000 girls. The proportion of male children stands at 50%. By the
end of the second year, half of the 100,000 families (the ones without a son)
have another child. This adds 25,000 boys and 25,000 girls. There are now
75,000 boys and 75,000 girls. The proportion of male children still stands at
50%. There are still 25,000 families without a son. They add another 12,500
boys and an equal number of girls, and so on.
Some people are tempted to suppose that because all large families have many
daughters and a single son, there must be more girls than boys. However,
there are not many large families.11"
88,Question 1.90,"/_387 Is 112.5larger or smaller than 400? You must do this in your
head. You are not allowed to use a calculator or pencil and paper.",1.9,Answer 1.90,"To compare 112.5with 400, I am going to square both sides and
ask how 115compares with 4002.I c a n q u i c k l y ﬁ g u r e t h a t 4 0 02is a 16 with
four zeroes after it. So, I will be looking at the leading digits of 115to see how
they compare with 16.
The number 11 has nice properties. For example, I know that 112= 121. In
fact, any number made just of ones, when squared, gives what I will call a
“podium” number. For example, 1 ,1112=1,234,321.
I have also memorized that 113=1,331. So, to get 115, I need to multiple
1,331 and 121 in my head. I can picture that (and I don’t know about you,
but I have to close my eyes for this one) I am going to have to add 133,100,
26,620, and 1,331. Subtracting 100,000 from the ﬁrst term and dropping any
thing smaller than 1,000, leaves me with 33,000, 26,000, and 1,000 which add
to give 60,000. So, adding back in the numbers I dropped, which I am not
going to actually bother doing, brings the grand sum to just over 160,000.
Thus, 112.5is a little bit bigger than 400."

93,Question 1.95,Prove that there are inﬁnitely many prime numbers.,1.95,Answer 1.95,"I give two related proofs that inﬁnitely many prime numbers exist.
FIRST SOLUT ION
Euclid gives a proof in about 300BC (Euclid, 2008, Book 9, Proposition 20).
Given a ﬁnite list of prime numbers p1,p2,...,p N,l e tΠ= p1·p2···pNbe
their product. Consider (Π + 1); either (Π + 1) is a prime number or it is
not. If (Π + 1) is a prime number, then our ﬁnite list of prime numbers was
incomplete, for (Π+1) is yet another. If (Π+1) is not a prime number, then it
is a composite number (i.e., a non-prime number). All composite numbers are
divisible by a prime number (Euclid, 2008, Book 7, Proposition 31). Let this
prime divisor be p.T h e n pcannot be one of p1,p2,...,p N.F o r ,i f i t w e r e ,s a y ,

bypi, which is absurd. Thus our ﬁnite list of prime numbers was incomplete,
forpis yet another.
In other words, given any ﬁnite list of prime numbers, yet another prime
number can be found. So, there must be inﬁnitely many prime numbers.

factorials to construct a sequence of nconsecutive positive integers none of

the following nsuccessive numbers:
[(n+1 ) !+2 ] ,[(n+1 ) !+3 ] ,[(n+1 ) !+4 ] ,...,[(n+1 ) !+( n+1 ) ] .
The ﬁrst number is divisible by 2, the second number is divisible by 3, and so
on, up until the nthnumber which is divisible by ( n+1 ) . I tf o l l o w st h a tn o n e
of these nconsecutive numbers is prime, which was to be shown.
Note that the ﬁrstnumber at which a run of nsuccessive composite numbers
