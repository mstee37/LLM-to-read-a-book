Question 4.1,"A breakfast cereal company gives away a free toy in each box of
cereal. There are four diﬀerent toys. How many boxes do you expect to have
to buy in order to get all four toys?"
Question 4.2,"Suppose we draw two random numbers XandYeach distributed
uniform on the interval [0 ,1]. If XandYare independent, what is the prob-
ability that their product is greater than 1/2?"
Question 4.3,"Suppose that X∼N(µ, σ2)( i . e . , Xis normally distributed with
mean µand variance σ2). Please write down the pdf fX(x)o fX. Where does
the constant factor in the pdf come from?"
Question 4.4,"Suppose that X∼N(µ, σ2), as in the previous question. What is
E/p⎬renleft⎭igX2/p⎬renright⎭ig?1"
Question 4.5,"Suppose that XandYare independent random variables each
distributed standard normal: X∼N(0,1), and Y∼N(0,1). What are the
variance and the standard deviation of X−Y."
Question 4.6,"/_387 Consider the following game. The player tosses a die once only.
The payoﬀ is $1 for each “dot” on the upturned face. Assuming a fair die, at
what level should you set the ticket price for this game?"
Question 4.7,"Ia mg o i n gt ot o s sf o u rc o i n s . Y o ua r eg o i n gt ot o s sﬁ v ec o i n s .
You win if you get strictly more heads than I do. What is the probability that
you win?"
Question 4.8,"I will roll a single die no more than three times. You can stop me
immediately after the ﬁrst roll, or immediately after the second, or you can
wait for the third. I will pay you the same number of dollars as there are dots

Question 4.9,"The correlation between XandYisρ.W h a t i s t h e c o r r e l a t i o n
between X+5a n d Y? What is the correlation between 5 XandY?
Story: One interviewee told me that the interviewers aim to put you under
as much pressure as possible, and that “you never know when they are going
to bring out the guy in the chicken suit. ”"
Question 4.10,"/_387 (**) Two sealed envelopes are handed out. You get one and
your competitor gets the other. You understand that one envelope contains
mdollars, and the other contains 2 mdollars (where mis unstated).3
1.Ifyou peek into your envelope, you see $X. However, you do not know
whether your opponent has $2 Xor $1
2X.Without peeking ,w h a ti sy o u r
expected beneﬁt to switching envelopes? What is your opponent’s ex-
pected beneﬁt to switching envelopes (assuming your opponent sees $Y)?
Should you switch? If you do, do you do it again for the same reason
(assuming neither of you peeked)?
2. Suppose that you both peek into your envelopes initially. What is the
payoﬀ to switching? Should you switch? If you do, do you do it again
for the same reason?"
Question 4.11,"They call this the “World Series” problem in the U.S. Sports
teams “A” and “B” are to play each other until one has four wins and is
declared the series winner. You have $100 to bet on Team A to win the
series. You are, however, only allowed to bet on individual games, not the
ﬁnal outcome directly, and, you must bet a positive amount on each game.
So, if Team A wins the series, you must walk away with $200, but if Team A
loses the series, you must walk away with zero, and you must do so having
placed a non-zero bet on every game. Your best assessment is that Team A
2If you were running this game, how much would you charge players for repeated plays of the
game? Suppose instead an amended game is played: I roll a single die three times without pause,
and the payoﬀ to the player is the maximum of the three rolls. What is the expected payoﬀ to
the player? Can you tell up front whether the original or amended game has the higher expected
payoﬀ?
3This problem is over 40 years old and is known as the “Exchange Paradox. ”

Question 4.12,"/_387 You have three children, but only one apple. You want to toss
a fair coin to determine which child gets the apple. You want each child to be
equally likely to get the apple. What is your strategy?4"
Question 4.13,A follow-up question to
Question 4.12,"What is the expected
number of tosses needed to complete this strategy?"
Question 4.14,/_387 Another follow-up question to
Question 4.12,"You have a fair
coin and you want to simulate an event that has probability 1/3, and an
event that has probability 2/3. How do you do it?"
Question 4.15,"What is the expected number of tosses of an unfair coin needed
to get two heads ( HH) in a row (assume probability pof a head)? Same
question with three heads ( HHH )i nar o w ."
Question 4.16,"You are tossing a fair coin and writing down the outcomes. What
is the probability that you will see the sequence HTH before you see the
sequence HHT ?"
Question 4.17,"You are tossing a fair coin and writing down the outcomes. What
is the expected number of tosses needed to obtain the outcome HTH ?"
Question 4.18,"/_387 You and I are to play a game. You roll a die until a number
other than a one appears. When such a number appears for the ﬁrst time, I
pay you the same number of dollars as there are dots on the upturned face of
the die, and the game ends. What is the expected payoﬀ to this game?"
Question 4.19,"You are dealt exactly two playing cards from a well-shuﬄed stan-
dard 52-card deck. The standard deck contains exactly four Kings. What is
the probability that both of your cards are Kings?
Story: It is many years ago now, but I know of a well-qualiﬁed MIT student
who got a job oﬀer of $X from a well-known ﬁrm (a good oﬀer at that time).
He declined, telling them that they had misjudged him. They called him
back a couple of days later and oﬀered him $ X×1.67 instead! Amazing! He
took the job."
Question 4.20,"/_387 (**) This is one version of the famous “Let’s Make a Deal” or
“Monty Hall” game show question. It is your turn to be on a weekly game
show. There are three doors. You know that there is a prize behind one of
them, and nothing behind the other two. The game show host tells you that
you shall receive whatever is behind the door of your choice. However, before
4In similar vein, suppose you had two children, one apple, and a biased coin. How do you use
the biased coin to fairly pick which child gets the apple?

Question 4.21,"(**) Now we will ask you the same question as the previous
one, except that when it comes time for the host to reveal an empty door,
he instead selects someone from the audience who chooses randomly and by
chance chooses a door that is revealed to be empty. Should you switch?
Note: There are two ways to interpret this question. You could assume that
the game can be played repeatedly with an audience member always revealing
ad o o rt ob ee m p t y ,o ry o uc o u l da s s u m eao n e - o ﬀg a m ew h e r et h ea u d i e n c e
member (ignorant of the prize’s location) just happens to have chosen an
empty door. Try answering both.
Story: A student interviewing with a top bulge bracket ﬁrm was asked how
he would move Mount Fuji. One of my colleagues suggested the answer “Call
Mohammed. ”"
Question 4.22,"You are presented with two empty jars and 100 marbles on a
table. There are 50 white marbles and 50 black marbles. You are to put all
100 of the marbles into the two jars in any way you choose. I will then blindfold
you. I will shake the jars up to ensure good mixing, and I will rearrange the
placing of the jars on the table so that you do not know which one is which.
You may then request either the “left-hand” or the “right-hand” jar. You get
to choose exactly one jar, you are allowed to withdraw at most one marble
from the jar, and you do not get a second chance if you are unhappy with your
choice.
5You can imagine variations of the problem where the host is not required to open another door
if doing so helps you, or where he does not open doors with equal likelihood. The solution may
diﬀer in those cases.

Question 4.23,"(***) Your name is Mr. 10. You are standing in a ﬁeld with
two opponents: Mr. 30 and Mr. 60. Each of you has a gun and plenty of
ammunition. Each of you is in clear sight of the others and well within ﬁring
range. The goal is to maximize the probability of survival. Unfortunately, you
are not a very good shot. If you take a shot at one of your opponents, you
have only a 10% chance of killing him. Mr. 30 is a better shot; he has a 30%
chance of killing whomever he shoots at. Mr. 60 is even better; he has a 60%
chance of killing his target. You take turns shooting in a pre-arranged order:
ﬁrst you, then Mr. 30, then Mr. 60, and then through this cycle again and
again until only one person remains.
You get to shoot ﬁrst. At whom, if anyone, do you shoot?7"
Question 4.24,"Basketball! Your team is down two points, you are the best
player, and you have the ball. There are only a few seconds left before the
buzzer. You can take a shot from three-point land or move up and take one
from two-point land. Historically, you have a 40% probability of getting the
shot in from three-point land and a 70% probability of getting the shot in from
two-point land.
Should you try for the three-point shot (a certain win if you make it), or
should you try for the two-point shot? Note that a two-pointer produces a tie
and puts you into overtime. We assume your team has a ﬁfty-ﬁfty chance of
winning in overtime."
Question 4.25,"Iw i l ls p i naf a i rr o u l e t t ew h e e lw i t ho n l yﬁ v es e c t i o n s . F o u ro f
the ﬁve sections pay $1; the ﬁfth pays $5.
1. If the cost is $1.50 per spin, and you may play as often as you want,
should you play the game?
2. If the cost is $1.50 per spin, and you may play exactly once, should you
play the game?"
Question 4.26,"If you like gambling and you like betting on the outcome of sports
matches, then you may like the “parlay card. ” A parlay card lets you bet on
the outcomes of more than one match. In order to win a parlay bet, you must
be correct on each of the matches you bet upon. Parlay cards oﬀer big payoﬀs
if you are right on every match (some even oﬀer a payoﬀ for “almost wins”).
6Can you answer the same question except that you are to minimize the probability of a white
marble? Does minimizing the probability of a white marble maximize the probability of a black
one?
7Does the answer change if the order is ﬁrst you, then Mr. 60, then Mr. 30, then you, and so
on?

Question 4.27,"What is the standard deviation of (1 ,2,3,4,5)?"
Question 4.28,"/_387 Welcome to your interview. Sit in this chair. Excuse me while

against your head. Close your eyes while I pull the trigger. Click! This is your
lucky day: you are still alive! Our game diﬀers from regular Russian roulette
because I am not going to add any bullets to the barrel before we continue,
and I am not going to give you the gun.
My question for you: I am going to shoot at you once more before we talk
about your resume. Do you want me to spin the barrel once more, or should
Ij u s ts h o o t ?9"
Question 4.29,"You have a large jar containing 999 fair pennies and one two-
headed penny. Suppose you pick one coin out of the jar and ﬂip it 10 times
and get all heads. What is the probability that the coin you chose is the
two-headed one?"
Question 4.30,"/_387 Four cards are shuﬄed and placed face down in front of you.
Their faces (hidden) display the four elements: water, earth, wind, and ﬁre.
You are to turn the cards over one at a time until you either win or lose. You
win if you turn over water and earth. You lose if you turn over ﬁre. What is
the probability that you win?
Story: “In his ﬁrst meeting with me, a candidate made himself a little
toocomfortable. Not only did he liberally pepper his conversation with
profanities, he also pulled his chair right up to the edge of my desk and
started examining papers and knickknacks. ”

9Edward O. Thorp, when discussing gambling roulette, mentions as an aside that when playing
Russian roulette, the eﬀect of gravity on the bullet(s) will inﬂuence the position of the revolver’s
cylinder (Thorp, 2017, p. 126–127). Please ignore this eﬀect here.

Question 4.31,"Two players AandBplay a marble game. Each player has both
a red and a blue marble. They present one marble to each other. If both
present red, Awins $3. If both present blue, Awins $1. If the colors do not
match, Bwins $2. The winnings come from an external source, not from the
other player. Is it better to be A,o rB,o rd o e si tn o tm a t t e r ?"

paid $1 times the number of dots on the upturned face of the die. You are
risk averse. Which game do you prefer?

Question 4.35,"In a survey of 1,000 people, 60% said they would vote for Can-
didate A for president (and 40% said they would vote for someone else). How
can you calculate a margin of error on the 60% estimate?"

Question 4.38,"(**) You are making chocolate chip cookies. You add Nchips
randomly to the cookie dough, and you randomly split the dough into 100
equal cookies. How many chips should go into the dough to give a probability
of at least 90% that every cookie has at least one chip?"
Question 4.39,"You will roll a fair die until the game stops. The game stops
when you get a 4, 5, or 6. For every number 1, 2, or 3 you have thrown
your score increases by +1. If the game stops with a 4 or 5, you get paid the
accumulated score. If the game stops with a 6 you get nothing. What is the
expected payoﬀ of this game?"
Question 4.40,"Take a stick and break it randomly into three pieces (i.e., two
randomly placed breaks on the stick). What is the probability you can form
a triangle from the pieces?"

Question 4.42,"Consider four boxes in a row numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. You start
with a pebble in Box 1. We toss a fair coin. If it is heads you move the pebble
forward one step to Box 2, but if it is tails you move the pebble forward two
steps to Box 3. Then we toss the coin again. If it is heads, you move the
pebble back to Box 1, but if it is tails you advance it to Box 4. If you reach
Box 4 the game is over. If you are back in Box 1, however, then we toss again
following the same rules. What is the expected number of coin tosses it will
take to reach Box 4?"

0×P(N) with probability 0 .5.
What is the expected number of generations until extinction?"
Question 4.51,"There are seven coins arranged in a circle. Every coin is heads-
up. Your goal is to ﬂip every coin so that it is heads-down. You may, however,
only ﬂip groups of three adjacent coins. You may ﬂip any such group of three
coins, and you may ﬂip as many such groups as you choose, one group at a
time. What is the minimum number of groups of three coins you can ﬂip in
order to ﬂip every coin so that it is heads-down?11"
Question 4.52,"You are going to roll three dice. What is the probability that
the highest of the three numbers will be exactly a 4? Please give your answer
to three decimals without using a calculator."
Question 4.53,"You are on vacation in a foreign country. You are sitting in a
restaurant looking out the window. Your waiter tells you that the bus service
stopping outside your restaurant window arrives as a Poisson process. As you
eat your ﬁshcakes, you pull out your stopwatch and you time two minutes
between the arrival of the ﬁrst and second bus that you see, and then 12
minutes between the second and third bus. Seven minutes passes after the
arrival of the third bus, and the fourth bus is not yet in sight. Stop now and
estimate the arrival rate λof the Poisson process.
11I have also heard of this question asked with reference to a rotating circular chandelier, with
seven illuminated light bulbs that you are trying to extinguish, and a switch that ﬂips the state of
the three nearest adjacent light bulbs. In practice, it is much easier to play with the problem at
home using coins than using light bulbs.

successful pass is when a player on one team kicks the ball to a player on their
team and it is not intercepted by the opposition. Is it possible for Italy to
have a higher proportion of its passes be successful than the U.S. in both the
ﬁrst and second halves, and yet for the U.S. to have a higher proportion of its
passes be successful over the game as a whole?"
Question 4.56,"We are going to play a game. You have a fair coin, and your
opponent has a fair coin. You are going to toss your coins together. If the
outcome is HH, you pay $6. If the outcome is HT or TH, you receive $5. If
