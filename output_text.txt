Note: This is a Print Replica eBook of the 22ndedition of Heard on The Street:
Quantitative Questions from Wall Street Job Interviews (August 2021). The page
size on the original book is 8.25x11 inches, so it is suitable for a tablet (rotated),
Mac, or PC. The font does not wrap, however, so it is not suitable for a small phone
or other small device.
When working through the questions, click on the question number to go to the
page containing the answer; the back button, or ALT+Left Arrow, takes you back
to the question. Alternatively, you can bookmark the question and then go back to
the bookmarked question when done. Alternatively, some readers choose to view
the questions and answers on two separate devices.
In addition to the Kindle table of contents, I have embedded a clickable table of
contents at the beginning of the book. Click on any heading to go to that section
or chapter.
For the beneﬁt of online shoppers, I have included two short preview chapters
at the beginning of the book. The preview includes a sample of 10 questions and
answers taken from the book (out of 239 quant questions and 264 non-quant ques-
tions). To skip over the preview, just click on either of the tables of contents and
go to the Introduction.
Questions that appeared in (or are likely to appear in) traditional corporate
ﬁnance job interviews are indicated with a bank ( /_387)o rh a l f - b a n k(/_387) symbol
in the margin, respectively (71 of the quant questions and 192 of the non-quant
questions). This makes it easier for corporate ﬁnance interviewees to go directly
to the questions most relevant to them. Most of these questions also appeared in
capital markets interviews and quant interviews. So, the marked questions should
notbe skipped over by capital markets or quant candidates unless they are obviously
irrelevant.

a prime number? What about the ISBN of the hard copy 20thedition (i.e., N=
9780995117389)? What is the quickest way, available at your ﬁngertips right now, to answer
these questions? How would you have answered these questions 50 years ago? What about
100 years ago? What characteristics will tell you immediately if Nis not a prime number
(e.g., N> 2 and Ndivisible by 2)? Look up “prime numbers” in the index to ﬁnd several
interview questions referring to them.

©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack vi All Rights Reserved WorldwidePreface
This book is a must read! It is the ﬁrst and the original book of quantitative
questions from ﬁnance job interviews. Painstakingly revised over 26 years and 22
editions, Heard on The Street has been shaped by feedback from hundreds of readers.
With well over 60,000 copies in print, it is unmatched by any competing ﬁnance job
interview book.
This revised 22ndedition contains 239 quantitative questions collected from ac-
tual job interviews in investment banking, investment management, and options
trading. The interviewers use the same questions year-after-year, and here they
are—with solutions! These questions come from all types of interviews (traditional
corporate ﬁnance, sales and trading, quant research, etc.). The questions come
from all levels of interviews (undergraduate, MBA, MS, PhD). This edition also in-
cludes 264 non-quantitative actual interview questions, giving a total of more than
500 actual ﬁnance job interview questions. There is also a section on interview
technique—based on my experiences interviewing candidates for the world’s largest
institutional asset manager, and also based on feedback from interviewers worldwide.
This book bridges the considerable gap between the typical ﬁnance education
and the knowledge required to successfully answer quantitative ﬁnance job inter-
view questions. The considerable gap arises because Wall Street interviewers must
separate the “wolves” from the “sheep.” The sheep are conﬁned by the boundaries
of their education; the wolves are not. The interview questions reach beyond these
boundaries in order to separate the two classes of interviewees. Hence the gap. Of
course, most interviewers are wolves. Unfortunately, many interviewees are sheep.
The butchering that takes place has been described to me as “horriﬁc. ” That is why
you need this book.
Ib r i d g et h ea b o v e - m e n t i o n e dg a pb yp r e s e n t i n gq u a n t i t a t i v eq u e s t i o n sf r o m
actual ﬁnance job interviews. My solutions and advice are carefully designed to
sharpen your quantitative skills. My advice is based on my experiences as a frontline
teaching assistant for MBA students at MIT, as a ﬁnance professor at Indiana
University, and as the former head of a quant research team for the world’s largest
institutional asset manager.
My intended audience includes interviewees (wolves and sheep alike) seeking
employment at Wall Street or other ﬁnance-related ﬁrms; their interviewers, who
need to weed out the hapless sheep; university professors who want to “spice up”
ﬁnance courses with Wall Street job interview questions (both for fun and to show
the importance of the basic concepts on The Street); students of ﬁnance who want
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack vii All Rights Reserved WorldwideCONTENTS
to ﬁll in some gaps; and ﬁnally, doctoral students in need of entertainment during
periods of downtime.
Many of the questions collected and presented here are “classics” that appear
year-after-year without fail. However, this book is deﬁnitely not for people who just
want “The Answers” to such questions. Such people are the archetypal sheep in
wolves’ clothing, and they are quickly identiﬁed as such in an interview. To beneﬁt
from this book, you must make a serious investment of your time.

Sample Questions
For the beneﬁt of online shoppers, who get to see about 30 pages of the book free of
charge, I have included two short preview chapters, followed by a list of references.
This chapter contains a sample of 10 questions taken from the book (out of 239
quant questions and 264 non-quant questions). The following chapter contains the
answers to these sample questions.
Q.1 Purely Quantitative & Logic Questions
Question Sample.1: /_387 You are given two glass jugs. Each contains the same vol-

the volumes of the jugs at their initial levels.
The initial concentration of alcohol in the alcohol jug equals the initial concen-
tration of water in the water jug (at 100%). What is the relationship between
the ﬁnal concentrations of alcohol in the alcohol jug and water in the water
jug?1
Question Sample.2: /_387 Interviewer: “You are a bug sitting in one corner of a cubic
room. You wish to walk (no ﬂying) to the extreme opposite corner (the one
farthest from you). Describe the shortest path that you can walk. Be sure to
mention direction, length, and so on.”
Question Sample.3: /_387 Fischer and Myron just stepped side-by-side onto a moving
escalator. They are climbing up the stairs, and counting steps as they climb.
Myron is climbing more quickly than Fischer. Myron climbs three steps in
the time it takes Fischer to climb only two steps. Neither of them skips any

steps. Myron steps oﬀ at the top, having counted 25 steps. He waits at the
top for the slower Fischer, who steps oﬀ having counted only 20 steps. How
many steps are showing on the escalator at any instant?
Q.2 Derivatives Questions
Question Sample.4: Suppose that you hold a long position in mortgage-backed
securities. If you are expecting a bond market rally, would you be better oﬀ
with positive convexity or negative convexity?
Question Sample.5: Two standard options have exactly the same features, ex-
cept that one has long maturity, and the other has short maturity. Which one
has the higher gamma?
Question Sample.6: Suppose that w(t)i sas t a n d a r dB r o w n i a nm o t i o n . F o r
which values of niswn(t) a martingale?
Q.3 Other Financial Economics Questions
Question Sample.7:/_387Deﬁne “duration” and “convexity. ” Describe their proper-
ties and uses.
Q.4 Statistics Questions
Question Sample.8: You are dealt exactly two playing cards from a well-shuﬄed
standard 52-card deck. The standard deck contains exactly four Kings. What
is the probability that both of your cards are Kings?
Question Sample.9: Suppose that XandYare independent random variables
each distributed standard normal: X∼N(0,1), and Y∼N(0,1). What are
the variance and the standard deviation of X−Y.
Q.5 Non-Quantitative Questions
Note that although all quantitative questions in this book are presented with de-
tailed answers, only about 10% of the non-quantitative questions are presented with
answers.
Question Sample.10: /_387 How would you value a hot dog stand in Midtown Man-
hattan?

Sample Answers
A.1 Purely Quantitative & Logic Answers
Answer Sample.1: This question has appeared over and over again. Although
simple, it is rarely answered well. No calculation is required to determine the
answer. If you used anyalgebra whatsoever, stop now, go back, reread the
question, and try again.
When the quantity Qof water is poured into the alcohol jug, the concentration
of alcohol in the alcohol jug becomesV
V+Q.A f t e r m i x i n g a n d p o u r i n g s o m e
back, the concentration of alcohol in the alcohol jug does not change again
(because no new water is added). However, when the diluted alcohol is poured
back into the water jug, the concentration of water in the water jug changes
from 100% toV
V+Q.T h a ti s ,t h eﬁ n a lc o n c e n t r a t i o n sa r ei d e n t i c a l .
How do you see that the ﬁnal concentrations must be identical? Remember,
you do not need any calculations at all. In fact, the only reason for any
calculation is if you also want to ﬁnd out what the ﬁnal concentrations are
(you were not asked this, but if you wish to work it out, your calculations need
not go beyond those of the previous paragraph).
Here is how it works. At the end of the process, both jugs contain the same
volume of ﬂuid as they did at the start. The only way for the concentration
of alcohol (for example) to have changed from 100% is if some alcohol was
displaced by water. Similarly, the only way for the concentration of water to
have changed from 100% is if some water was displaced by alcohol. Volume is
conserved (both total volume and volume in each jug), so all that has happened
is that identical quantities of water and alcohol have traded places (and these
identical quantities are slightly less than Q). By symmetry, the concentrations
of alcohol in the alcohol jug and water in the water jug must be identical. This
ﬁnal result is true no matter how many times you repeat the experiment.
If you are still stuck, here is another way of thinking about it. Imagine a
black bucket with 1,000 black marbles in it and a white bucket with 1,000
white marbles in it. Suppose I take 100 black marbles out of the black bucket
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 3 All Rights Reserved WorldwideCHAPTER A. SAMPLE ANSWERS
and put them in the white bucket and mix it up really well. Then I have
1,100 marbles in the white bucket, and the great majority of them are white.
Suppose I then take 100 marbles from those 1,100 and use them to top the
black bucket back up to 1,000 marbles. Then both buckets have 1,000 marbles
again. Let us suppose that 91 (i.e., the great majority) of the 100 marbles used
to top up the black bucket were white. That means I must have returned only
9o ft h eo r i g i n a l1 0 0b l a c km a r b l e sb a c kt ot h eb l a c kb u c k e tw h e nIt o p p e d
it up. That means I must have left 91 black marbles behind in the white
bucket—the same as the number of white marbles that migrated over to the
black bucket. So, the proportions are identical!
Answer Sample.2: You (the bug) cannot ﬂy; you have to walk. You must ﬁnd
the shortest path from corner to corner.
In any world, the shortest path between two points is called a “geodesic. ” On
a spherical world (e.g., the Earth’s surface), a geodesic is an arc of a “great
circle. ” A great circle is a circle on the surface of the sphere with diameter
equal to the diameter of the sphere. For example, airplanes typically follow
great circles above the Earth (because it is the shortest path and, therefore,
the most fuel-eﬃcient path).
Like a spherical world, the cubic-room world has a two dimensional surface.
However, the lack of curvature in the cubic-room world means that the shortest
distance between two points must be a straight line rather than an arc of a
great circle (in a world without curvature, geodesics are straight lines).
If the cubic room is opened up and ﬂattened out it can be seen that the shortest
path is a straight line from one corner to the other. In the un-ﬂattened room,
this straight line corresponds to two line segments that meet exactly halfway
up one wall-ﬂoor or wall-wall boundary. Direct computation using Pythagoras’
Theorem1reveals that the total path length is√
5u n i t s .
Answer Sample.3: I give three successively shorter solutions. The ﬁrst is a
hammer-and-tongs solution that lays everything out in detail. The second
is more elegant, and the third is more elegant still. Each solution brings
something slightly diﬀerent to the table.
FIRST SOLUT ION
LetDbe the number of steps showing on the escalator at any moment ( D
for distance, counted in units of one step). Let ebe the (assumed constant)
speed of the escalator, in steps per second. Let vMbe Myron’s relative speed
of ascent up the escalator (which is the same whether the steps are moving or
not). If vM= 0, then Myron will climb zero steps under his own steam. If
vM=∞,t h e nM y r o nw i l lc l i m b Dsteps. So, it will be the relative diﬀerences
in speed that let us identify D.
1In this case, the path is the hypotenuse of a triangle of side lengths 2 and 1 in the ﬂattened-out
room or two hypotenuses of triangles each of side lengths 1 and1
2in the un-ﬂattened room. In
either case, the path is of total length√
5.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 4 All Rights Reserved WorldwideA.1. PURELY QUANTITATIVE & LOGIC ANSWERS
Myron’s absolute speed up the incline holding the escalator is e+vM.S o ,
Myron must cover the distance Din time tM, spent on the escalator, as given
by Equation A.1.
tM=D/(e+vM) (A.1)
How many steps does Myron climb in time tM?W e l l , a t s p e e d vM,w ej u s t
need to multiply time taken by speed, as in Equation A.2.
steps climbed (Myron) = tM·vM=DvM/(e+vM) (A.2)
We should double check that the RHS of Equation A.2 conforms to our intu-
ition. If we plug vM= 0 into Equation A.2 we get zero steps, as expected, for
anye>0. Similarly, if we take the limit of Equation A.2 as vM→∞,w eg e t

Now let vFdenote Fischer’s slower speed, where 2 vM=3vF.T h e n , f r o m
Equation A.2 and the relative speeds, we have Equations A.3–A.5.
steps climbed (Myron) = 25 = DvM/(e+vM) (A.3)
steps climbed (Fischer) = 20 = DvF/(e+vF) (A.4)
2vM=3 vF (A.5)

Now subtract the second equation from the ﬁrst, and cancel out vFto deduce
that D=5 0 .
As an aside, note that Equations A.3–A.5 are three equations in four unknowns
(D,e,vM,a n d vF). You will recall that if you have three linear equations
in four unknowns, there can be no unique solution. In our case, however, the

Can you conﬁrm that for every proposed numerical example in the previous
paragraph, it was also true that e=vM(i.e., the escalator speed is the same as
the speed of the faster climber)? Must this be true for all numerical examples
in the framework given? Could you have deduced this result before solving for
D=5 0 ,a n du s e dt h i sf a c tt oh e l ps o l v et h ep r o b l e m ?
SECOND SOLUT ION
Keeping all the notation from the ﬁrst solution, note that Myron carries himself
up 25 of the Dsteps, while the escalator carries him the other, say, xsteps.
Thus, 25 + x=D. We will solve for x,a n dt h e nf o r D.
Fischer walks more slowly than Myron. When Fischer has carried himself up
only 20 steps, the escalator will have carried him up k·xsteps, for some k>1.
Thus, 20 + ( k·x)=D. That is, the escalator does more work on Fischer’s
behalf than it does on Myron’s behalf, by a factor of k.
Now, because Myron and Fischer entered side-by-side and the escalator is
moving at a constant speed, this means that when Myron reaches the top, the
escalator has carried both of Myron and Fischer a total of xsteps by that
stage. Fischer, however, has climbed up only2
3as many steps as Myron by
then. That is, Fischer has climbed only 25 ·2
3=1 62
3of his eventual 20 steps
by then. His full trip will take20
162
3=1.20 times as long as he has taken so far.
Given the constant speed of the escalator, this means that the escalator will
end up carrying him an additional 20% of the xit has already carried him.
That is, k=1.2. Putting these together yields Equations A.6–A.8.
25 + x=D (A.6)
20 + ( k·x)= D (A.7)
k=1 .2 (A.8)
Plugging the third equation into the second, and subtracting the result from
the ﬁrst equation, yields 5 −0.2x=0 . S o , x=2 5 ,a n d D= 50, as before.

Alternatively, using the notation from the ﬁrst two solutions, note that Fischer
spent more time on the escalator than Myron. Myron travelled 25 steps at

A.2 Derivatives Answers
Answer Sample.4: A quick review of “mortgage-backs” is in order. Mortgage-
backed securities are shares in portfolios of mortgages. The value of all U.S.
mortgage-backed securities outstanding was $9,880,600,000,000 ($9.8806 tril-
lion) at the end of Q2 2019, according to SIFMA’s web site. This compares
with $8.7663 trillion ﬁve years earlier (Q2 2014), $8.390 trillion at the end
of 2006, and $2.606 trillion at the end of 1996. The Q2 2019 total is com-
posed of agency MBS (75%), agency CMO (11%), non-agency CMBS (6%),
and non-agency RMBS (8%), where the acronyms stand for mortgage-backed
securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage-backed
securities, and residential mortgage-backed securities.
Owners of mortgage-backs are exposed to “prepayment risk,” and “extension
risk. ” Prepayment risk is the risk that interest rates will fall, and borrowers
will exercise their right to reﬁnance at lower rates (they exercise their call
option on the mortgage). The problem is that the holders of the mortgage-
backs, therefore, get repaid when interest rates are low—the worst possible
time to receive the money. Conversely, extension risk is the risk that interest
rates will rise, and borrowers will slow down their rate of repayment—meaning
that holders of mortgage-backs get fewer dollars to invest at precisely the best
time for them to be investing. Mortgage-back investors thrive when interest
rate volatility is low.
The simplest mortgage-back is a “pass-through”—each share in the mortgage
pool provides a pro-rata share in the cash ﬂows to the pool, and thus each
share has identical risk and return characteristics.
Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO’s) are a type of mortgage-back that
splits the mortgage pool up into “tranches” (the French word for “slice”).
Unlike a pass-through, which gives equal shares to all holders, the tranches
are unequal shares. Take a simple example with only four tranches: “A,” “B,”
“C,” and “Z. ” The A, B, and C shares all receive regular coupons. The A
shares are retired (i.e., the principal is repaid) ahead of the other tranches
by using the earliest prepayments by borrowers. The B shares are retired,
through prepayments, only after the A shares are gone. The C shares are
retired, through further prepayments by borrowers, only after the A and B
shares are gone. The Z shares receive no payouts whatsoever until all of the
A, B, and C shares are gone. You may think of the Z shares as being like zero-
coupon bonds with a life equal to the life of the longest-lived mortgages in the
pool. CMO tranches thus provide diﬀerent risk-return proﬁles—in contrast to
pass-throughs.
With borrowers long a call on the mortgage (i.e., the right to buy back the
mortgage by prepayment), holders of mortgage-backs are short a share of each
of these calls from the mortgage pool. You will recall, of course, that long
calls have positive convexity and that short calls have negative convexity.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 7 All Rights Reserved WorldwideCHAPTER A. SAMPLE ANSWERS
In the absence of the call feature of a mortgage-back (the fact that borrowers
have the right to prepay early), the mortgage back has positive convexity as a
function of interest rates—just like an ordinary non-callable bond (Sundaresan
[1997, p. 393]). However, when interest rates are low, the call feature becomes
important to borrowers. If interest rates fall, all borrowers will reﬁnance by
the time rates have fallen to some critical value. At this stage, the mortgage-
back is worth par. When interest rates are low, the importance of the call
feature (a short call position to the mortgage-back holder) means that the
mortgage-back can acquire negative convexity.3Negative convexity is also
called “compression to par” because of the convergence of the security’s value
to par as interest rates fall (Sundaresan [1997, p. 394]).
Note that although the mortgage-back value may have negative convexity, it is
still downward sloping as a function of interest rates. However, if interest rates
are low and close to the coupon rate of the mortgage back, then an increase in
volatility of interest rates can decrease the value of the security (Sundaresan
[1997, p. 394]). This result follows because the holder of the mortgage back is
short the calls that the borrowers are long—and calls increase in value with
volatility.
Now to the interview question. If you are long mortgage-backs, and you expect
a bond market rally, then you expect bond yields to fall and bond prices to
rise. Thus, your position will gain in value. The question is, which sign on
convexity would maximize the gain (+ or −)? Positive convexity provides a
steeper downward sloping plot of security value as a function of interest rates,
and this in turn implies a larger gain if rates fall—thus, you prefer positive
convexity.4
Af u l la n s w e rn o t e st h a tw eh a v ea s s u m e da parallel shift in the yield curve.
If the yield curve steepens or ﬂattens, the answer could change. Whether
additional convexity helps or hurts you depends upon the type of yield-curve
shift and the particular bonds under consideration. It needs to be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis. See the related discussion beginning on p. 19.
Answer Sample.5: The gamma of an option is the rate of change of its delta,
∆, with respect to stock price—denoted Γ. Option gamma is also called
“curvature,” or “convexity.” Gamma is non-negative for standard puts and
calls (their deltas rise with increasing S). Put-call parity tells us that the
gamma of a European call is the same as the gamma of a European put.
Option value “decays” toward kinked ﬁnal payoﬀ as expiration approaches (see
Figure A.1—ﬁrst panel). This time decay is called “theta. ” We usually think
3In fact, this is a feature of any callable bond—if interest rates fall far enough, the call feature
kicks in and imparts negative convexity to the security.
4Convexity is not such an issue if you expect a bond market rout. When prices fall and rates rise,
prepayment becomes less attractive, and the call option in the hands of the borrowers assumes less
importance—and so does the negative convexity the call is able to impart to your mortgage-back
security value.

about theta as being negative for plain vanilla options, but there are two clear
exceptions. A deep in-the-money European-style call can have positive theta
if the dividend yield is high enough—because high dividends can push price
down below intrinsic value and the option then has to “decay upward” in value
as expiration approaches. Similarly, a deep in-the-money European put decays
upward in value—because life does not get much better than a deep-in-the-
money American put, but the European put cannot be exercised immediately
and hence the discount. Crack (2021) discusses this in more detail.
Theta is large and negative for at-the-money options, and it increases in mag-
nitude as maturity approaches. Theta and gamma are typically of opposing
signs (the positive theta cases mentioned above are exceptions), so large neg-
ative theta typically goes hand-in-hand with large positive gamma. That is,
shortening maturity accelerates at-the-money option prices towards the kink
and also gives more curvature (i.e., gamma) in the plot of option value as a
function of stock price (see Figure A.1—third panel).
The maturity/gamma relationship is reversed away from the strike price. If a
call is deep in-the-money, then ∆ →1, as expiration approaches (for a deep in-
the-money put,∆→−1 as expiration approaches). Thus, short maturity calls
or puts that are deep in-the-money have deltas that do not vary much as S
changes. With little variation in delta, the gamma is close to zero. If an option
is instead deep out-of-the-money, then its gamma is also close to zero because
its delta is close to zero with little variation across S. It follows that for away-
from-the-money standard options, shorter maturity implies lower gamma for
both puts and calls (see Figure A.1—third panel).
The gamma (i.e., convexity) for a standard European call on a stock that pays

With ( T−t)>0, the formula for Γ shows that as S(t)→∞,t h en u m e r a t o r

having Sin the denominator pushes Γ in the opposite direction as S→0.
The exponentiation of d2
1in the numerator is much more powerful than the
linearity of Sin the denominator, so the ratio, Γ, is forced to zero as S→0.
If the option is exactly at-the-money [i.e., S(t)=X], then as maturity ap-
proaches, you have a knife-edge singularity. You get d1→0, so the numerator

Inﬁnite gamma means the sensitivity of delta to small changes in price of the
underlying is inﬁnite. This means that the delta can jump from one-half up to
one, or down to zero with just a hair’s breadth move in the stock price. In this
knife-edge scenario, any delta-hedge that you establish is extremely sensitive
to a move in the underlying—you are not hedged.
If you try gamma-hedging (adding traded options to your delta-hedge to repli-
cate the convexity of the derivative), you will need many traded options in your
hedge portfolio, and it may become diﬃcult to manage the position.5Your
problems are similar (but much worse) if hedging barrier options (i.e., “knock-
outs”) as the price of the underlying approaches the knock-out barrier. The
problem is worse near a knock-out’s barrier than near a standard call’s kink.
This is because the knock-out’s delta can jump from one to zero whereas the
standard call’s delta jumps only from one-half to zero, or one-half to one.
For most American-style options (and for the more complicated Europeans),
there is no closed-form formulae. You will probably have to calculate Γ using
numerical techniques.

Duration is a measure of how sensitive a bond’s price is to changes in interest

how duration works.7Suppose that you have a liability due in the future
and that you buy a bond now with the intention of using the bond (and its
reinvested coupons) to meet the liability (the maturity of the bond is assumed
to be greater than or equal to the maturity of the liability). Suppose that
7I have not seen my construction in the literature. Kritzman (2003, Chapter 7), however, comes
close to this explanation when he gives some elementary insights into duration and convexity.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 13 All Rights Reserved WorldwideCHAPTER A. SAMPLE ANSWERS
the present value of the bond is identical to the present value of the liability.
Suppose that you open a bank account that earns the market interest rate
(i.e., the yield-to-maturity of the bond). You deposit all cash in-ﬂows from
the bond in the bank account and let them compound through time (with no
taxes or transaction costs). When your liability falls due, you sell your bond
and close your bank account. Call the proceeds of the bond sale together with
your ﬁnal bank balance the “Terminal Value.”
Can you meet your liability with the Terminal Value? Well, there are two
risks involved. A fall in interest rates immediately after you purchase the
bond pushes up the price at which you are able to sell your bond. However, a
fall in interest rates also decreases your ﬁnal bank balance because you earn
less interest on the coupons. The opposite obtains with a rise in interest rates.
That is, higher interest rates decrease the price at which you can sell the bond,
but your closing bank balance is higher because you earn more interest on the
coupons. These two risks are known as price risk andcoupon reinvestment
rate risk ,r e s p e c t i v e l y .
Price risk and coupon reinvestment rate risk have opposite inﬂuences on the
Terminal Value. The Terminal Value diﬀers depending upon which inﬂuence is
strongest. It can be proved that if your liability falls due before the weighted-
average term-to-maturity of your bond, the price risk has the stronger inﬂuence
on Terminal Value. If, however, your liability falls due after the weighted-
average term-to-maturity of your bond, the coupon reinvestment rate risk has
the stronger inﬂuence on Terminal Value. If your liability falls due precisely at
the weighted-average term-to-maturity of the bond, the Terminal Value is rel-
atively insensitive to an immediate change in interest rates. By deﬁnition, the
weighted-average term-to-maturity of the bond is just its Macaulay duration.
Redington (1952, p. 289) introduced the word “immunization” to refer to a
particular type of liability matching involving “investment of the assets in such
aw a yt h a tt h ee x i s t i n g[ i n s u r a n c e ]b u s i n e s si si m m u n et oag e n e r a lc h a n g ei n
the rate of interest.” He also says that the distribution of the term of the
ﬁxed income assets in relation to the term of the liabilities should be “in such
a way as to reduce the possibility of loss arising from a change in interest
rates” (Redington, 1952, p. 289). This requires both that the value of the
assets and liabilities match and that the durations of assets and liabilities
match (Redington, 1952, p. 290). Note that an initial immunized position
protects you from exactly one immediate parallel shock to a ﬂat term-structure
(Redington, 1952, p. 292; Shiu, 1990). This shock is assumed to be very small
(Redington, 1952, p. 290; Shiu, 1990). You are no longer immunized after
that shock has hit because it changes present values and duration. Although
you are no longer immunized, you still have a non-immunized hedge in place.
That is, you still get your planned future Terminal Value as long as no more
shocks hit.
Note that you must re-balance after each shock to stay immunized. In fact,

to stay immunized, you must rebalance even if no shocks hit. This is because,
absent a zero-coupon bond position, changes in bond duration are not in lock-
step with the passage of time. So, your horizon and your bond’s duration
decrease at diﬀerent speeds, and you become non-immunized.
Im u s te m p h a s i z et h a tm yb a n ka c c o u n t / T e r m i n a lV a l u ec o n s t r u c t i o ni sa n
artiﬁcial one. The fact that you must rebalance your position as time passes
(in order to remain immunized) means that you cannot stick with the same
bond until the liability is due. Indeed, the only bond that you can hold until
the liability falls due (while remaining immunized) is a zero-coupon bond with
maturity equal to the maturity of the liability; and in this case, the absence
of coupons removes the need for the bank account in the construction.
So, if you can open a bank account that pays the yield-to-maturity on your
bond, purchase a coupon bond with duration and present value the same as
those of the liability, and deposit all coupons in the bank account until the
liability falls due, then, if there is one and only one small parallel shock to
the ﬂat term-structure of interest rates between now and your liability falling
due, and if that single shift in interest rates occurs immediately, then the
Terminal Value will meet your liability (although you will not be immunized
against a second shock). You are not, however, immunized against a large
or non-parallel shift in the yield curve (Redington, 1952, p. 290, 294; Shiu,
1990).8
Other things being equal, duration increases with increasing term-to-maturity.9
Other things being equal, duration decreases with increasing coupons (larger
cash ﬂows early on decrease the proportional importance of the repayment of
principal at maturity).
Compared to duration, convexity is a higher-order measure of sensitivity of
bond price to interest rates. Convexity is a scaled measure the rate at which
the sensitivity of bond price to interest rates changes with changing interest
rates (Crack and Nawalkha [2001]). Convexity is related to, but diﬀers from,
the rate of change of slope of the plot of bond price versus yield-to-maturity.
See the summary in Table A.1. For a practitioner’s view of Macaulay duration
and convexity, see Kritzman (1992b).10
How do the deﬁnitions of duration and convexity arise? Suppose the price of
an annual-coupon bond, P, is expanded in terms of yield-to-maturity, r,u s i n g
8See Reitano (1992), Zheng (2007), and Poitras (2013) for discussion of immunization in these
more complicated cases.
9Deeply-discounted coupon-bearing bonds (i.e., bonds paying coupons far below current market
rates) can be an exception (Fisher and Weil [1971, Table 4, p. 418]).
10The standard Macaulay duration is a relatively simple concept. People on The Street expect
you to know that they use more complex tools. For example, the standard Macaulay duration can
be generalized to allow for immunization against parallel shifts in yield curves that are notﬂat.
This generalization was originally proposed by Macaulay (1938), but was made popular by Fisher
and Weil (1971). An even more sophisticated measure of duration is presented by Cox, Ingersoll,
and Ross (1979). Duration measures for bonds with embedded options are also important (Mehran
and Homaifar [1993]).

with increasing coupons. Even a zero-coupon bond has positive convexity
(because C1=C2=···=CT−1=0 ,b u t CT=F a c e >0).
In addition to immunization, duration and convexity enable you to estimate
the impact on bond price of a change in interest rates. A “ﬁrst-order” estimate
uses duration; a “second-order” estimate uses duration and convexity. Higher-
order approximations are more accurate.
Take a 20-year bond paying an annual coupon of 7%. Assume a face value of
$1,000. Assume that the term-structure is ﬂat at 10%. The price of the bond
is $744.59 under these assumptions.
If the entire term-structure rises by one percentage point (i.e., 0.01), what
is the new price of the bond? This can be estimated using the equation we
11Note that this is similar to expressing the change in the price of a call option (given a change
in the level of the underlying) in terms of the “delta” and the “gamma. ” The delta is the rate of
change of call price with respect to underlying, and the gamma measures the “convexity” of call
price with respect to underlying.

The Macaulay duration of this bond is calculated as 10.0018 years, the convex-

Thus, P(r+∆r)≈P+∆P=$ 7 4 4 .59−$62.85 = $681 .74.Direct evaluation
gives the answer as $681.47 (the estimate is 27 cents too high and would have

Thus, P(r+∆r)≈P+∆P=$ 7 4 4 .59 + $72 .53 = $817 .12.Direct evaluation
gives the answer as $817.43 (the estimate is 31 cents too low and would have
been out by roughly $5 if not for the convexity term).14
Note that the “27 cents too high” and the “31 cents too low” in the above
examples can be reduced to pennies (at least) by using a third term in the
expansion—a measure of rate of change of convexity with respect to yield.
Mehran and Homaifar (1993) refer to this third term as “velocity,” though
that name is not commonly used. Thus, they represent change in bond price
as a function of duration, convexity, and velocity—see Mehran and Homaifar
(1993) for more details.15

14Why am I estimating the change in bond price when direct evaluation gives the exact answer?
For purposes of demonstration, it is convenient to be able to show you exactly how the duration
and convexity measures work and where the approximations break down. This simple example
is a good way to do that. In a real world situation, you might know the current value of your
bond portfolio and its duration and convexity. It may be easier (and much faster) to estimate how

Macaulay duration may be written using a closed-form formula (i.e., with no

Then for a standard bond with annual coupons of C,a n df a c ev a l u e F,t h e
Macaulay duration in Equations A.9 and A.10 may be rewritten as D=

standard closed-form formula for an annuity and, although not diﬃcult, may
be a little tedious—a similar type of expression exists for convexity.
Note that D∗=D/(1 + r) in Table A.1 generalizes to D∗=D/(1 + r/m)
in the case of a bond paying mcoupons per period. So, taking the limit as
m→∞(i.e., as we move to continuous compounding), we get D=D∗,a s
mentioned in the caption to Table A.1.
Finally, let me exorcise a myth. Most of the foregoing is predicated on parallel
shifts in yield curves. Other things (i.e., price and duration) being equal, the
higher the convexity of a bond, the better oﬀ you are if there is a parallel
shift (up or down) in a yield curve: hence the myth that you should pay for
convexity.16In reality, these shifts are anything but parallel (Jones [1991];
Litterman and Scheinkman [1991]). Other things (i.e., price and duration)
being equal, if the yield curve steepens, additional convexity will probably
hurt you. Whether additional convexity helps or hurts depends upon the
bonds you consider, and the “twist” in the yield curve that occurs. Crack and
Nawalkha (2000) derive simple expressions that allow bond portfolio managers
to capture the combined eﬀects of term-structure height, slope and curvature
shifts on duration, convexity, and higher-order bond risk measures. See Kahn
and Lochoﬀ (1990) and Lacey and Nawalkha (1993) for empirical evidence.
A.4 Statistics Answers
Answer Sample.8: The naive answer is that the probability is just2
52≈4%.
This is incorrect. There are four chances that the ﬁrst card dealt to you (out
your portfolio changes in value with changes in interest rates—using current value, duration, and
convexity—than it is to directly evaluate each bond individually.
15People on The Street tell me that duration measures accounting for embedded options are
important. Mehran and Homaifar (1993) discuss duration and convexity for bonds with embedded
options. Before looking at Mehran and Homaifar (1993), be sure that both your mathematics and
ﬁnance are up to scratch. They have the ideas correct, but their notation is contrary to conventional
symbolic mathematics.
16This win-win situation is not kosher. A model that allows only parallel shifts in the yield curve
freely admits arbitrage opportunities: match on price and duration and go long high convexity and
short low convexity (Shiu, 1990; Lacey and Nawalkha 1993).

of a deck of 52) is a King. Conditional on the ﬁrst card being a King, there
are three chances that the second card dealt to you (out of the remaining deck
of 51) is a King. Conditional probability says that
P(Both are Kings) =
P(Second is a King |First is a King) ×P(First is a King)
where “ |”i sr e a da s“ c o n d i t i o n a lu p o n , ”o r“ g i v e n . ”T h i si sas p e c i a lc a s eo f
the more general conditional probability result:
P(A∩B)=P(A|B)×P(B)
Thus, P(Both are Kings) =3
51×4
52=1
17×1
13=1
221≈0.5%. Therefore, you
have roughly one chance in 200 of getting exactly two Kings dealt to you.17
I wish you to avoid a common form of confusion. Please note that although
you multiply probabilities to get the answer, and such multiplication is often
done when dealing with independent events, the events here (King on ﬁrst
card, and King on second card given King on ﬁrst card) are dependent ,n o t
independent. That is, you calculate the probability that the second card is a
King given that, or dependent upon , the ﬁrst card being a King.
I wish to emphasize that the above procedure is diﬀerent from that for ﬁguring
out the probability that, for example, you get two heads in two tosses of a fair
coin (this probability is1
2×1
2=1
4). The outcomes of the coin tosses are
genuinely independent , and this is why you can multiply their probabilities
directly. That is, P(H1∩H2)=P(H2|H1)×P(H1)=P(H2)×P(H1) because
the probability of a head on the second coin toss is not inﬂuenced by the event
that you get a head on the ﬁrst coin toss (i.e., the conditional probability
formula still applies but it reduces to the product of probabilities if the events
are independent). However, the probability that you get a King on the second
card dealt isinﬂuenced by the event that you get a King on the ﬁrst card
dealt. That is why the conditional probability theory is used. Be sure you
understand the distinction and how and where to apply each method. If it is
not clear, go to your favorite statistics book for a review (e.g., see Feller [1968,
Chapter V]).

think about this is that because Yis symmetric about zero, the signed ran-
dom variable −Yis, from a probabilistic standpoint, the same as the random
variable Y.T h a t i s , i f Y∼N(0,1), then −Y∼N(0,1) also. So, X+Y
andX−Yare then probabilistically the same. That is, the random variables
X+YandX−Yhave the same mean, the same variance, the same skewness,
the same kurtosis, etc. In other cases (e.g., XandYlognormal or chi-squared,

results need not.

to hear you talk your way through it to see your personality (to see if you

What are they trying to get at with this question? Skills, skills, skills. Can
you think on your feet and identify the important factors that feed into any
business valuation? Are you aware of competing valuation techniques? Did
you miss anything important?
What answers are they looking for? They do not necessarily need you to
arrive at a numerical answer in this case, because some of the inputs cannot be
estimated accurately until you do some research. So, I would focus on method,
rather than numerical answers in this case. In other valuation questions they
might supply enough data for a numerical answer, or they might sit you in
front of EXCEL and ask you to build a spreadsheet.

I would announce that I will try two diﬀerent techniques. My ﬁrst approach
involves market-determined prices for comparables: I know that NY sells li-
censes for street vendors via competitive bids. So, supply and demand means
that the winning bids should give a rough estimate of a lower bound on the
value. Winning bids are likely public, and should at least put me in the
ballpark. Diﬀerent locations (e.g., beside a major tourist hotspot, near to or
distant from competing vendors) will carry diﬀerent values. I would try to
ﬁnd something as comparable to the hot dog stand of interest as possible.
For my second approach I would look at a standard discounted cash ﬂow
(DCF) analysis (Crack, 2020b). I need to forecast cash ﬂows and discount
them back at an appropriate discount rate. So, I need to say what kinds of
cash ﬂows I will use and where I will get them, what sort of horizon I should
use, and what an appropriate discount rate is.
I need unleveraged free cash ﬂows (FCF) to capital. I would go out maybe 7-10
years and estimate a terminal value there using a perpetuity. FCF are given
by operating cash ﬂows (OCF) plus changes in net working capital (NWC)
less capital expenditure (CAPEX) plus any sundry tax eﬀects.
To get OCF I have to make an estimate of the foot traﬃc I will see, the typical
transaction, the operating costs (ﬁxed cost of the license, equipment rental,
wages and variable costs of the product I sell), and depreciation (if I bought
the stand). I would need to do some research on these: I could observe some
vendors, check out wholesale costs of products, etc. NWC will be modelled in
as p r e a d s h e e t ,b u tg i v e nh i g ht u r n o v e r ,It h i n ki tw i l lb eas m a l lr u n - u pa tt h e
start and then nothing much going on. CAPEX might be very low in this case
if the stand is rented, or could be quite high initially if the stand is purchased
outright.
The cost of equity could come from comparable publically traded small busi-
nesses in a similar line, but via the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).
Something like Chipotle might be a good place to start. Remember to unlever
the beta from the comparables and relever to your capital weighting (which
is likely to be mostly debt I assume). I also need a market risk premium;
standard numbers are 5%–7%.

It’s not enough to know the names of these concepts; you have to be prepared
for the interviewer to drill more deeply on any one of the above-mentioned
items.
Other competing techniques for ﬁrm valuation include the LBO method (not
obviously better than DCF here), and the less-popular DDM method (but
there are no obvious dividends to discount) (Crack, 2020b).

timates of all the above costs. Maybe a license is $10,000 per month, maybe
the stand operates eight hours a day and I have one minimum wage employee
working with me, maybe a stand costs $50,000 to build, or $1,000 per month
to rent, maybe the typical transaction is $7 with costs of $1 and we can serve
two people per minute for eight hours a day, etc. I think you’ll need pencil
and paper or a whiteboard or a spreadsheet to put this all together.

©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 37 All Rights Reserved WorldwideIntroduction
This book ﬁrst appeared in 1995 with questions collected from MIT students after in-
terviews. Twenty-six years on, in 2021, the interviewers at top ﬁrms frequently send
me their new questions directly! For example, one interviewer at a big-name New
York investment bank sent me the bank’s latest full written quantitative interview
test with three dozen questions (and answers)! A European banking contact sent me
40 quantitative questions and 20 non-quantitative questions from a bulge-bracket
bank’s interviews. A top UK quant recently sent me 50 quant interview questions he
uses, most with suggested answers, plus a handful of pointed non-quant questions.
Why do interviewers and other contacts at top ﬁrms give me their interview
questions to put in a book to sell to their job candidates? It is because the job
candidates who make a serious investment of time in studying the questions and
answers are signaling that they deserve to be hired!
All of the quantitative questions are accompanied by detailed solutions. The
questions are split into four categories: Purely Quantitative and Logic, Derivatives,
Other Financial Economics, and Statistics (Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively).
The solutions appear in Appendices A, B, C, and D, respectively. Chapter 5 presents
non-quantitative questions from actual interviews (with selected solutions in Ap-
pendix E). In the text, a name followed by a year (e.g., “Girsanov [1960]”) refers to
a work cited in the References (following the appendices).
Questions that appeared in, or are likely to appear in, traditional corporate
ﬁnance job interviews are indicated with a bank ( /_387)o rh a l f - b a n k(/_387)s y m b o l
in the margin, respectively (71 of the quant questions and 192 of the non-quant
questions). This makes it easier for corporate ﬁnance interviewees to go directly
to the questions most relevant to them. Most of these questions also appeared in
capital markets interviews and quant interviews. So, the marked questions should
notbe skipped over by capital markets or quant candidates unless they are obviously
irrelevant.
If you are interviewing for options jobs and you need a review book to com-
plement the interview questions here, then you should buy my book Basic Black-
Scholes ,C r a c k( 2 0 2 1 ) .S e et h ea d v e r t i s e m e n ta tt h ee n do ft h i sb o o kf o rd e t a i l s ,o r
go directly to www.BasicBlackScholes.com .Basic Black-Scholes started its life as
an extended appendix to this book, but it was carved out as a book in its own right,
and has been revised many times. Its original aim was to help interview candidates.
So, the writing style should be well suited to your interview preparation.

Questions in This Book
The questions in this book were collected by me from interviewees, interviewers, and
others. I have taken the liberty of rewording them for maximum clarity because,
unlike in an interview, you have no immediate opportunity to ask me for clariﬁcation.
Sometimes I give only part of a question that was asked; sometimes I combine related
questions into a larger one. I remain faithful to the original problem statement
wherever possible.
Is o m e t i m e sa d daf o o t n o t et oaq u e s t i o n . T h ef o o t n o t ec o n t a i n sas l i g h tv a r i a t i o n
on the question. Unless otherwise indicated, these “footnote questions” are made
up by me and are not actual job interview questions. All other questions come from
actual job interviews (even the “condom question”).
Many of the questions require a serious investment of your time. Knowing the
answer is not enough in and of itself. Interviewees should attempt as many of these
questions as possible without peeking at the answers. Mastering the problem-solving
process gets you the job. This may mean spending hours, or days, with a problem
before you master it. Although my answers often provide guidance in technique, I
think that the path of greatest resistance (i.e., not peeking at the answers) bears
the highest rewards!
Interviewers can use these questions as they stand. However, I strongly encour-
age you to push candidates very hard for the underlying understanding. Ask them
to explain the answer, not to simply solve the problem. This diﬀerentiates those
who understand the problem from those who merely know the answer. The good
ones meet the challenge; the bad ones do not. Many people can solve problems, but
only the best genuinely understand what they are doing.
Will the questions in this book become obsolete or dated? The answer is no,
for two reasons: First, many of the questions are “classics” that appear consistently
year-after-year; and second, the body of quantitative skills required to solve these
questions has remained unchanged for three decades. Even if some of the questions
change, the skills required to solve them do not. It is these skills that my book
promotes. For these reasons, it follows that these questions are genuinely timeless.1
Sometimes the classiﬁcation of a question (and, therefore, the chapter it should
be in) is by no means clear. For example, some of the ﬁnancial economics questions
look like statistics questions, and I have placed questions on stochastic calculus in
the derivatives chapter instead of the statistics chapter.
Some questions have more than one solution technique. The “right answer” may
be the wrong answer if you use a “brute-force” approach and completely miss an
elegant alternative (I often give both techniques).
Some questions are more diﬃcult than others. I have labeled diﬃcult questions
with two stars “ (**)”a n dv e r yd i ﬃ c u l tq u e s t i o n sw i t ht h r e es t a r s“ (***) .” B y
default, all other questions deserve one star. For the two-star or three-star questions,
your approach, rather than your solution, may be of more importance. You should
1At ﬁrst glance, some questions may seem dated (e.g., “Suppose that IBM is trading at $75 per
share... ”). However, I could easily have made it “Stock XYZ” (contrary to the original wording),
and you would not have noticed. Where possible, I retain the original wording for authenticity.

be able to set up a general framework for a solution. If you can solve such questions
on the spot, you are doing well.
Some of the questions are at a low level, and you may think it beneath your
dignity to answer them. I have, however, interviewed people who claim to have
degrees in ﬁnance, economics, statistics or mathematics, who cannot answer basic
ﬁnance, economics, statistics, or mathematics questions, respectively. If you think
the basic questions are beneath you, then prove it by walking through them like a
hot knife through butter. If you cannot answer the basic questions, however, either
because you are rusty on the basics, or simply never understood them, then why
should anyone hire you? No one will want to put you in front of their team members,
clients, or traders, all of whom will have basic questions for you.
If you are interviewing for a more quantitatively oriented job where knowledge of
C (but probably not C++) is required for the interview (and C++ may be required
for the job itself), I recommend Mongan, Suojanen and Gigu` ere (2012) to you.
You must have already heard all the ordinary interview advice (cover letters,
appearance, comments on previous employers, use of bad language, chewing gum, re-
searching people who will interview you, researching the ﬁrm, knowing your strengths
and weaknesses, and so on); if not, then see Fry (2016). To answer the type of ques-
tions in this book, however, you may need the extraordinary advice that follows.
Will They Ask me These Questions?
Yes; you must assume that they will. You can hope for the best, but you must pre-
pare for the worst. Some ﬁrms use the ﬁrst round of interviews to get to know you
with soft and non-quantitative questions. In this case, a second round typically fol-
lows with quantitative questions. Other ﬁrms use a quantitative ﬁrst round to screen
applicants up front. However, some ﬁrms ask no quantitative questions. There is
thus a chance that you will see no quantitative questions. In this unlikely event,
my quantitative questions will have exercised your IQ, and my non-quantitative
questions (Chapter 5) will have been of most assistance.
On the non-quantitative front, many interviewees have been asked, “Where did
the Dow close yesterday?” or “Where did the Nikkei close?” or “Where is the 10-
year bond?” In addition to current knowledge, you should also know how these (and
other) basic economic variables have changed over the recent past, and where they
are relative to all-time highs and lows—see Chapter 5 for more examples. Even if
you are very busy interviewing with many ﬁrms, you must not be found ignorant
on such basic market knowledge.
Interviewers care about the “four points of the compass”: skills ,ﬁt,eﬀort ,a n d
acceptance .T h ei n t e r v i e w e rw a n t st ok n o wt h a ty o uh a v et h es k i l l st od ot h ej o b ,
that you ﬁt into the culture of the ﬁrm, that you will make the eﬀort needed if
hired, and that you will accept the job if it is oﬀered to you. If you fail to convince
the interviewer on any one of these points, then you will not be shortlisted. Every
job interview question, quantitative or otherwise, targets at least one of these four
points. They are discussed further below, and on p. 347.

ATQ!
“ATQ” stands for “Answer The Question!” Let us suppose that I am the interviewer
and that I have little patience. I am busy. Damn busy! I have a deadline for my
boss on a project that is due tonight (he is in an earlier time zone). I walked away
from the stack of work on my desk, and the spreadsheet (or code) I desperately need
to ﬁnish just so that I can talk to you. Spending 30 minutes with you means I get
home at 10:30 pminstead of 8:00 pm, because I have to ﬁnish my project, and I will
miss the last direct train. I earn $250,000, $500,000, $1M, or more per annum. I
got my job and kept it because I am eﬃcient and I understand time management.
I want to hire a good person, but if you waste my time then I will crucify you;
perhaps not to your face, but to my colleagues, both at this ﬁrm, and at competing
ﬁrms thinking of interviewing you.
I know from past experience that people with good resumes are not necessarily
knowledgeable in their claimed area of expertise. If you have a degree in ﬁnance, or
mathematics, or whatever, and cannot answer a basic question in that area, then
how the heck can I let you answer the phone, or bring you to a meeting with a
client, or let you talk to our traders, or take you to a meeting with the portfolio
managers, or have you join me in a conference call with my boss? That is, how can
I hire you if you cannot answer basic questions? I know that there will come a time
in this interview or the next when I have to push you to answer some quantitative
questions, so that I can see what you understand and what you do not. Some of
the questions will be basic, and some of them will not be basic. I need to know
the limits of your knowledge, and I cannot ﬁnd them by asking soft wishy-washy
questions about your resume.
If I ask you a question, then answer the damn question! If you know the answer,
then tell me it. If you do not know the answer, but can work it out, then tell me that
and outline the steps; I may be happy with that, and then not need to see the full
derivation. If you have only a passing knowledge of the area, or no hope whatsoever
of answering the question, then I need you to say so directly, and without wasting
my time, so that I can ask you other questions. I need to know the boundaries of
your abilities, and to ﬁnd them I must ask you a mix of questions including ones
that you cannot answer at all. Do not waste my time by ﬂoundering around and,
in eﬀect, drowning yourself in your own ignorance.
For example, suppose it is a bond trading job and I ask you whether the curvature
in the plot of bond price versus yield to maturity is caused by changing Macaulay
duration as yield changes. Let us suppose that you know the answer, but instead of
giving it to me directly, you say:
“Well, that’s an interesting question. We know that for a standard coupon-bearing bond
with no embedded options, the plot of bond price versus yield to maturity is downward slop-
ing and concave up. Let me draw that on the whiteboard here (draws picture). As yield
rises, other things being equal, bond price falls, but the dollar rate at which the bond price
falls actually decreases as yield to maturity rises. That is, the slope becomes less negative.
Changing slope means that there is curvature, and sure enough the plot is concave up. Now,
some people may think, naively, that the slope of the plot is just the Macaulay duration of
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 41 All Rights Reserved WorldwideINTRODUCTION
the bond. Now, it is well known that as yield to maturity rises, other things being equal,
the Macaulay duration of a standard coupon-bearing bond with no embedded options falls.
So, these people would deduce, naively and incorrectly, that as yield to maturity rises, the
changing slope is simply a reﬂection of changing Macaulay duration. However, the simple
fact that the Macaulay duration of a standard coupon-bearing bond with no embedded op-
tions is positive, and that the slope of our plot is negative, tells us that the slope is not the
Macaulay duration. It is not the negative of the Macaulay duration either, and we can see
that by looking at the case of a zero-coupon bond. Suppose we plot bond price versus yield
to maturity for a ten-year zero with no embedded options. The plot is downward sloping
and concave up, as before, with slope becoming less negative as yield to maturity rises, but
the duration is 10 years regardless of the yield—because it is a zero. That is, where the
slope is of large magnitude, the Macaulay duration is ten; where the slope is of intermedi-
ate magnitude, the Macaulay duration is ten; and, where the slope is of small magnitude,
the Macaulay duration is ten. Thus, slope does not equal Macaulay duration, or negative
Macaulay duration, and the curvature of the plot cannot simply be a reﬂection of changing
Macaulay duration. Now, the slope of the plot of the price of the standard coupon-bearing
bond versus its yield to maturity is af u n c t i o no fM a c a u l a yd u r a t i o n ,b u ti ti sa l s oaf u n c -
tion of bond price and yield to maturity. If we write down the slope explicitly, we see that
it is −D
(1+r)P,w h e r e Dis Macaulay duration, Pis bond price, and ris yield. If we look
at numerical examples, we can see however, that the duration does not change very much
with changing yield. Indeed, as already mentioned, it does not change at all in the case
of a zero, and low-coupon bonds are not that diﬀerent from zeroes. Rather, it is the bond
price that changes signiﬁcantly with changing yield, and it is this that causes changes in
the slope, thus producing curvature. Sure enough, in the case of a coupon-bearing bond, the
changing Macaulay duration contributes to the change in slope, and thus to the curvature,
but its contribution to curvature is much less important than the contribution of changing
bond price. So, no , it is not changing Macaulay duration, but rather, changing price, that
drives the change in slope, thus creating curvature.”
Well, you just spent two and one-half minutes of my valuable time saying that.
That is ten percent of your interview time. In your favor, you got to the correct
answer, which is “no,” but in so doing you gave me so many words that I ceased
caring whether you knew the answer or not. I did ﬁgure out, however, that if you
were working on my team, I could not take you to a presentation to clients because
you would take for bloody ever to answer their questions. I also ﬁgured out that
you really like hearing the sound of your own voice. You may well be someone who
does not realize that time is money, that that money belongs to my clients, or to
the ﬁrm, and that that money has a heck of a lot of zeroes on the end of it.
You should have just answered “No, changing bond price drives changing slope
and creates curvature.” You should then add that “Changing Macaulay duration
contributes marginally to curvature for a coupon bearing bond, but not at all in
the case of a zero.” If the question has a “yes” or “no” answer, and you know the
answer, then the ﬁrst word out of your mouth should be “yes,” or “no,” respectively.
Anything else means you are not getting to the point, and you are wasting my time
and your golden opportunity! Obviously, you support your assertion immediately
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 42 All Rights Reserved WorldwideINTRODUCTION
with more words, but answer the question ﬁrst! ATQ!
I have had people talk a full ten minutes or more before coming anywhere near
allowing me to detect whether they know the answer or not. After the ﬁrst minute
Ih a v ea l r e a d yd e c i d e dt h a ty o ua r ei nt h ew r o n gb u i l d i n g ,a n dIa mt h i n k i n ga b o u t
the stack of work on my desk. I stopped caring about your answer back in the
ﬁrst chapter of your saga. I am about to cancel the next person on your interview
schedule because I value his or her time almost as much as I value my own. Unlike
me, you get to go home early today.
To repeat, if the answer is “yes,” and you know it, then say so! If the answer
is “no,” and you know it, then say so! You can add words after that, to support
your answer, but for God’s sake, get to the point! Suppose you are on a date with a
person you ﬁnd exceptionally attractive, and you are dancing, and this person says,
“Do you want to kiss me?” Are you going to talk to them for ten minutes about
how you arrive at your decision or are you going to get to the point? Similarly, you
must have had a professor at college who when asked a question from the audience
mid-lecture would take ﬁve minutes giving his answer. When he got to the end of it
you did not know what the answer was he had given, and you just wished he would
shut up and move on. He invariably followed it up with “Is that clear now?” and
no one dared say “no,” for fear he would talk more about it. The bottom line is,
answer the question! Remember ATQ, or even ATFQ! , if it helps hammer it into
your skull.
If you do not know the answer, but know enough to try to work it out, than say
something like “Hmmm. I do not know, but I think I can work it out. I know that
the slope is given by −D
(1+r)P,w h e r e Dis duration, Pis price, and ris yield. I
am not sure how much of the change in slope is explained by changes in each of D
andP,b u tId ok n o wt h a taz e r oh a sﬁ x e d D,s oIs u s p e c tt h a tc h a n g i n g Pis more
important than changing D.” That is ﬁne. You told me you did not k now, and then
you tried to work it out. That diﬀers from knowing, but failing to tell me until the
end of a saga.
If a question is not clear, be sure to ask for clariﬁcation. For example, “Is it a
straight bond with no embedded options?,” “Are there coupons?,” etc.
If the interviewer tells you that your answer is incorrect when you know it is
correct, and if you are dead sure of your answer, then defend yourself to the hilt.
Interviewers make mistakes, and you can earn their respect (and a job) by correcting
them. Good people want you to do that in practice—though do it tactfully in front
of their colleagues.
Other Advice
As an interviewer, I assume that you are at your best when I see you. You are
wearing your best clothes and shoes, you have a great haircut, you are smiling,
upbeat and positive, you are engaged in your best conversation, etc. You are, in all
respects, on your best behavior. Nevertheless, I had a guy turn up to an interview
wearing dirty clothes and smelling like he had not washed in six months. I watched in
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 43 All Rights Reserved WorldwideINTRODUCTION
horror as another candidate made repeated ﬂirtatious/inappropriate remarks about
his married male interviewer’s body during the interview. During a day of scheduled
interviews, a candidate disappeared just after seeing my colleague, and just before
he was supposed to see me. After ﬁve minutes of us wondering where he went, he
turned up late and stinking of cigarette smoke. He obviously thought it was more
important to step outside and grab a cigarette than it was to be on time with me. I
listened to a female candidate who was so sleep deprived that she stumbled through
an interview and was barely able to put two sentences together. I saw a candidate
come to an interview with blood stains on his shirt collar; He said he had cut himself
shaving that morning. (Always bring twoshirts, cleaned and pressed, when you ﬂy
out to an interview!) On another occasion, a slow-talking European candidate with
a deeply dull and depressing monotone voice spent an interminable amount of time
during his phone interview describing the cold gray winter he was facing if he did not
get a new job; I pictured him tying a noose while talking to us. I once interviewed a
morbidly obese candidate who seemed depressed, moribund, and was barely able to
communicate. After a ﬁve-minute bathroom break, however, he came back dancing
like an excited ballerina and he could not stop talking or moving. What did he
inhale? I once saw a guy turn up for a banking interview wearing a white jacket
and white dress shoes. I could go on, and on. As an interviewer, I ask myself “If the
candidate behaves this way during the job interview, then how will he/she behave
on the job?” If this is you at your peak, and on your best behavior, then I have to
assume that it is downhill from here.
Do not confuse the comments in the previous paragraph with a criticism of
nervous behavior by candidates. We expect you to be a little bit nervous. As
interviewers, we apply a discount rate for nervousness. What we will not put with,
however, is lack of preparation, or a poor attitude, or stupid or bad behavior.
The ﬁnance community is small and interwoven, and corporate memory is long.
If you interviewed at the ﬁrm before, your interviewer probably knows about it
and will talk to the people you talked to, even if they have moved on. Indeed, if
you worked/interviewed/studied anywhere in the world, the interviewer can ﬁnd a
former colleague, interviewer, adviser etc., of yours, who is known to them and who
can assess you. Your resume may have circulated widely within the ﬁrm, both in its
local oﬃces and overseas, before you set foot in the building or pick up the phone.
Indeed, your resume might have circulated so widely that no one informs HR, and
no one even remembers where your resume came from; that can explain why you
never got any response, not even a rejection.

are not just interviewing for the job that was advertised. There are other openings
at the ﬁrm that have not yet been advertised (and may never be advertised), and
there are openings at other ﬁrms that your interviewer knows about because he
or she knows people there. There will also be other openings at the interviewing
ﬁrm in the future. If they like you and your CV, but do not think you are suited
to that one job, then they may recommend you strongly to another team leader
within their ﬁrm or even at another ﬁrm. (This backdoor network of contacts is
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 44 All Rights Reserved WorldwideINTRODUCTION
used all the time in recruiting. If I pass your details on to someone at another ﬁrm
today, they will pass their candidate’s details to me next week. This quid pro quo is
part of the equilibrium that helps equate supply and demand in the labor market;
everybody beneﬁts from it.) The implication of this is that if you discover quickly
that you are not suited to the position advertised, or the ﬁrm, then you should steer
the interview toward your strengths and ask the interviewer to keep you in mind for
other positions. He or she may even tell you of another opening. (See also the ﬁrst
story on p. 77.) Of course, this phenomenon can work out badly for you too. If your
interview is awful, the interviewer will happily pass that information to other people
if they ask about you, at that ﬁrm and other ﬁrms. For a really bad performance,
the interviewer will pass on information about you without even being asked.
I interviewed a guy who I was not sure about. I started the interview by saying
that I thought he was not the right guy for the job. I was not trying to play some
sort of psychological game; I was just expressing my doubts, assuming that he would
turn around and tell me why he wasthe right guy. Instead, he amazed me by wilting
on the spot. So, you should have a shortlist of several reasons prepared to counter
any claim that you are not the right person for the job.
Your resume is often a starting point. Never, never inﬂate it. When a resume
arrives on the desk of the interviewer, he or she looks at it and tries to ﬁgure out in
advance some questions to ask. If you write on your resume that you took an option
pricing class, and got an “A,” then if the interviewer is an option pricing nut, you
just guaranteed that the interview is going to get hot. If the area is a weakness for
you, then do not make yourself a target. If you want to advertise that you took the
class, then that is ﬁne, but prepare yourself for incoming questions.
On 100% of CVs where the candidate lists “attention to detail” as a skill, I have
found obvious errors caused by a lack of attention to detail! So, get your resume
proofread by multiple people, including someone with English as a ﬁrst language.
I received three cover letters that stand out in my mind. One from a young
woman applying for a junior quant position who stated that she had “a lot of love
to give,” one from a graduate of Rutgers who seemed to think I was suﬃciently
stupid not to have heard of Rutgers and felt the need to describe the school in
great detail, and one from someone saying that they had always wanted to work
in investment banking (when I was working at that time for an asset management
company). You have sent your CV and cover letter out to act as your ambassador
in your absence. Remember, at every step of the interview process, your aim is
to get to the next step of the process. So, a substandard eﬀort here can kill your
opportunity for an interview as surely as any ridiculous social media webpage or
moronic email address can.
Do not smoke just before your interview. Get a stop smoking patch or something
similar. The same goes for garlic for 24 hours before your interview. It stinks!
Similarly, no one likes shaking hands with a limp dead ﬁsh. If your hands drip like
al e a k yf a u c e t ,t h e np u ty o u rh a n di ny o u rp o c k e t( w a r ma n dd r y ) ,o rp a l md o w n
on your lap, or under your thigh if you are sitting, right up until the point at which
you shake hands. It is simple but eﬀective.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 45 All Rights Reserved WorldwideINTRODUCTION
One in three males I have ever interviewed put his ﬁnger up his nose during the
interview. I kid you not. They seem to be unaware of it. Perhaps it is nerves. They
expect me to shake hands with them at the end of the interview, but I always ﬁnd
aw a yo u to fi t .K e e py o u rd a m nh a n d so ﬀy o u rf a c ed u r i n gt h ei n t e r v i e w !
Intelligent or genuinely humorous small talk is ﬁne, but do not make a fool of
yourself. For example, one guy came back a week later for a second round interview
with me. I went to greet him in the foyer, and he looked at me blankly. Then he
suddenly said “I remember you!” and “This is for the quant position, right?” Those
were his ﬁrst words! One of my co-authors said “You are better oﬀ being yourself
......b u t b e y o u r bestself” (Butler and Crack, 2019, p. 4).
Cover letters go in the garbage can, and e-mails are deleted. Make sure your
e-mail address and phone number are on your CV. Make sure you have reliable
voicemail, and check it often. If HR cannot ﬁnd you quickly, then someone else can
interview for your job before you can—even if we ranked you higher.
Do not ask how many hours they work, or what they pay. You do not care how
many hours it takes; You love working long days and nights. You do not care what
the pay is; you just want to get your foot in the door.
Show me that you love the industry and the challenge. Even if the market is
bad, and you are out of work, you must be upbeat. If you tell me a tale of woe, all
Ic a nt h i n ki st h a t“ 9 9 %o fy o u rl i f ei sw h a ty o um a k eo fi t ,a n di fy o u rl i f es u c k s ,
you suck. ” Why would I want you sitting next to me at work all day? Be positive.
People like people who like them.
Show passion; make it plain. The words “I want this job” should come out of
your mouth plainly and clearly during the interview. Why? Well, surprisingly often
(surprisingly often!), when you have gone, we interviewers sit down and discuss
amongst ourselves whether you really wanted the job, and we conclude that you did
not. We ﬁgured you for a “tourist,” or someone seeking an oﬀer to use as leverage
with your current employer or some other employer, or someone whose heart was
simply not in it. You failed to convince us on the acceptance point of the compass,
and we are not going to waste a line on you (see the next paragraphs for further
discussion of this). So, we are always amazed when we subsequently hear from some
mutual contact that you were shattered not to get to the next stage. So many
candidates interview with us for reasons other than getting a job that we have
diﬃculty distinguishing between those who want a job and those who do not. Hell,
you acted like you did not want the job! We are not psychic. If you want the job,
then tell us you want the job!
Do not underestimate the importance of the last point of the compass: accep-
tance .F r o m a n i n t e r v i e w e r ’ s p e r s p e c t i v e , I a m v i g o r o u s l y c o m p e t i n g w i t h o t h e r
ﬁrms to hire out of the current pool of applicants. Making an oﬀer to you uses up
one “line” (think of them as ﬁshing lines cast into the pool of applicants). I may
have only one or two lines available. So, if I decide during the interview that you
are unlikely to accept an oﬀer, then I will not tie up one line with you (waiting for
your answer, while my competitors pluck the best ﬁsh out of the pool). Even if you
convinced me on skills ,ﬁtandeﬀort ,Iw o u l dr a t h e rs a v et h a tl i n ef o rs o m e o n em o r e
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 46 All Rights Reserved WorldwideINTRODUCTION
likely to accept my oﬀer. Indeed, one ﬁrm is famous for asking “If we oﬀer you a
job right now, will you say yes?” If you say “I have to think about it” or “I need
to make a phone call” then you are out. Forget about it; why should I waste any
further time on you?
Near the end of the interview, interviewers often ask “Do you have any questions
for me?” If you have no question(s), then you fail on the eﬀort andﬁtpoints of the
compass. Having no question is like arrogantly slapping your interviewer in the face.
What do you think will happen if you end the interview that way? Your question(s)
must be one(s) whose answer(s) cannot be found online. For example, “Do you have
any reservations about hiring me that we can discuss right now?,” “What challenges
will your division face over the next year?,” or “Why did you join the company?,”
or “What do you ﬁnd most satisfying about working here?” or “What is the best
advice you can give me to achieve long-run success here?”
If you thought the interview was over when you walked out the door, then you
misunderstood. At the very least, I expect to get a simple two-sentence follow-up
email from you, almost immediately, thanking me for the interview. If you put a
foot wrong during the interview, perhaps by giving a wrong answer to an interview
question, then your follow-up email should say “Thank you for the interview. As
soon as I walked out of the building I realized that in my nervousness I answered that
question about [whatever it was] incorrectly. I should have said... ” The interview
is not over yet; I am sitting there waiting for your damn email! If I do not get
that email, especially one that corrects a mistake, then your failure demonstrates a
lack of eﬀort, and that you did not really want the job in the ﬁrst place. If I had
any doubts previously, then I can now conclude for sure that you would not have
accepted an oﬀer from us, and so, I will not waste a line on you.
It’s not over until it is over! If several weeks have passed since the interview, and
you have heard nothing, but you are still interested, then I expect to get a follow-up
email from you reiterating your interest, and reminding me that you exist. By this
time I have already had second-round interviews with your competitors, and maybe
they all failed, or failed to accept our oﬀers. So, you may look very attractive now.
If you are still interested, then I am expecting you to contact me again. If you
do not contact me again, then I must conclude that you are not interested, either
because you got a job already, or because you were never interested to begin with.
Finally, the ex-post probability that you get the job is either zero or one. If you
prepare as though it is zero, then it will be. If you prepare as though it can be one,
then you can make it so. I have every conﬁdence in you.

Purely Quantitative & Logic
Questions
With a few exceptions, the only prerequisites for answering the questions in this
chapter are elementary quantitative skills and common sense. Some questions here
have both an elegant technique and a brute-force technique. The technique you
choose is revealing. Solutions for this chapter appear in Appendix A.
Question 1.1: /_387 You are given two glass jugs. Each contains the same volume,
V,o fl i q u i d . O n ej u gc o n t a i n sp u r ea l c o h o l ,a n dt h eo t h e rj u gc o n t a i n sp u r e
water. A modest quantity, Q,o fw a t e ri sp o u r e df r o mt h ew a t e rj u gi n t ot h e
alcohol jug, which is then thoroughly mixed. The same modest quantity, Q,
of (now diluted) alcohol is then poured back into the water jug to equalize the
volumes of the jugs at their initial levels.
The initial concentration of alcohol in the alcohol jug equals the initial concen-
tration of water in the water jug (at 100%). What is the relationship between
the ﬁnal concentrations of alcohol in the alcohol jug and water in the water
jug?1
Question 1.2: /_387 Fischer and Myron just stepped side-by-side onto a moving es-
calator. They are climbing up the stairs, and counting steps as they climb.
Myron is climbing more quickly than Fischer. Myron climbs three steps in
the time it takes Fischer to climb only two steps. Neither of them skips any
steps. Myron steps oﬀ at the top, having counted 25 steps. He waits at the
top for the slower Fischer, who steps oﬀ having counted only 20 steps. How
many steps are showing on the escalator at any instant?
Question 1.3: /_387 There are two bells. One rings ﬁve times per minute, and the
other rings four times per minute. If they start at the same time, how long
will it be until they next ring together?
1This is not a chemistry problem. Please ignore the fact that mixing a volume V1of water with
av o l u m e V2of alcohol results in a total volume less than V1+V2.F o l l o w - u pq u e s t i o n :R e p e a tt h e
mixing, and ask the same question. Now do it again, and again, and ask the same question.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 48 All Rights Reserved WorldwideQuestion 1.4: /_387 What is the sum of the integers from 1 to 100?2
Question 1.5: /_387 An old style analog clock falls oﬀ the wall and the face breaks into
three pieces. The numbers on each piece add to the same total. Describe the
pieces.
Question 1.6: /_387 (**) You are given a set of scales and 12 marbles. The scales are
of the old balance variety. That is, a small dish hangs from each end of a rod
that is balanced in the middle ( /_554). The device enables you to conclude either
that the contents of the dishes weigh the same or that the dish that falls lower
has heavier contents than the other.
The 12 marbles appear to be identical. In fact, 11 of them are identical, and
one is of a diﬀerent weight. Your task is to identify the unusual marble and
discard it. You are allowed to use the scales three times if you wish, but no
more. Note that the unusual marble may be heavier than the others, or it
may be lighter; you do not know which. You are asked to both identify it and
determine whether it is heavy or light.
Question 1.7: /_387 Suppose I inscribe a circle within a square so that the circle just
touches the four sides of the square. Suppose there is exactly enough room to
ﬁt a rectangle of dimensions 5 ×10 into one corner of the square so that the
rectangle just touches the circle. See Figure 1.1. What is the side length of
the square?
Question 1.8: /_387 Interviewer: “You are a bug sitting in one corner of a cubic room.
You wish to walk (no ﬂying) to the extreme opposite corner (the one farthest
from you). Describe the shortest path that you can walk. Be sure to mention
direction, length, and so on.”
Question 1.9: /_387 A mythical city contains 100,000 married couples but no children.
Each family wishes to “continue the male line,” but they do not wish to over-
populate. So, each family has one baby per annum until the arrival of the ﬁrst
boy. For example, if (at some future date) a family has ﬁve children, then it
must be either that they are all girls, and another child is planned, or that
there are four girls and one boy, and no more children are planned. Assume
that children are equally likely to be born male or female.
Letp(t)b et h ep e r c e n t a g eo f children that are male at the end of year t.H o w
is this percentage expected to evolve through time?
Story: One candidate for a futures trading position in Chicago was asked:
“Would you rather be beaten up, beat someone up, or run around the block
naked?” The last response did not get him the job. My wife was horriﬁed to
hear this story. Welcome to Chicago!

Figure 1.1: The Inscribed Circle Question
Note: A circle is inscribed within a square. A rectangle of dimen-
sions 5 ×10 just ﬁts in one corner. What is the side length Sof
the square?
Question 1.10: /_387 Picture a 10 ×10×10 “macro-cube” ﬂoating in mid-air. The
macro-cube is composed of 1 ×1×1 “micro-cubes,” all glued together. Weather
damage causes the outermost layer of micro-cubes to become loose. This
outermost layer falls to the ground. How many micro-cubes are on the ground?
Question 1.11: /_387 There are two cities, A and B, 1,000 miles apart. You have
3,000 apples at City A, and you want to deliver as many as possible of them
to City B. The only delivery method available is a truck. There are, however,
two problems. The truck can hold at most only 1,000 apples, and if there are
any apples at all in the truck, the hungry dishonest driver will steal and eat
one apple for every mile he drives. What is the maximum number of apples
you can deliver from City A to City B? Note that you are welcome to stop
part way, dump oﬀ some apples, and then come back and pick them up later.
Question 1.12: /_387 How many degrees (if any) are there in the angle between the
hour and minute hands of a clock when the time is a quarter past three?
Question 1.13: /_387 What is the ﬁrst time after 3 pmwhen the hour and minute hands
of a clock are exactly on top of each other?
Question 1.14: /_387 There are 100 light bulbs lined up in a row in a long room. Each
bulb has its own switch and is currently switched oﬀ. The room has an entry
door and an exit door. There are 100 stockbrokers lined up outside the entry
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 50 All Rights Reserved Worldwidedoor. Each bulb is numbered consecutively from 1 to 100. Each stockbroker
is numbered consecutively from 1 to 100.
Broker number 1 enters the room, switches on every bulb, and exits. Broker
number 2 enters and ﬂips the switch on every second bulb (turning oﬀ bulbs
2, 4, 6, ...). Broker number 3 enters and ﬂips the switch on every third bulb
(changing the state on bulbs 3, 6, 9, ...). This continues until all 100 brokers
have passed through the room.
What is the ﬁnal state of bulb number 64? Is it illuminated or dark?
Question 1.15: /_387 Exactly the same set-up as Question 1.14, with a diﬀerent ﬁnal
question: How many of the light bulbs are illuminated after the 100th person
has passed through the room, and which light bulbs are they?
Question 1.16: /_387 Your bedroom sock drawer contains eight red socks and 11 blue
socks that are otherwise identical. The light is broken in your bedroom, and
you must select your socks in the dark. What is the minimum number of socks
you need to take out of your drawer and carry into your (well-lit) living room
to guarantee that you have with you at least a matching pair to choose from?
Question 1.17: /_387 Following on from the previous question, can you generalize your
answer to otherwise-identical socks of Ndiﬀerent colors? For example, suppose
you have 50 socks of color 1, 50 socks of color 2, . . . , and 50 socks of color N,
how many socks must you pull from your sock drawer in the dark to guarantee
that you have a matching pair?
Question 1.18: /_387 Following on from the previous two questions, your bedroom
sock drawer contains 2 red, 4 yellow, 6 purple, 8 brown, 10 white, 12 green,
14 black, 16 blue, 18 gray, and 20 orange socks. It is dark, so you cannot
distinguish between the colors of the otherwise-identical socks. How many
socks do you need to take out of the drawer to guarantee that you have at
least three pairs of socks of the same color?

Question 1.19: /_387 You and I are to play a competitive game. We shall take it in
turns to call out integers. The ﬁrst person to call out “50” wins. The rules
are as follows:
1. The player who starts must call out an integer between one and 10,
inclusive;
2. A new number called out must exceed the most recent number called by
at least one and by no more than 10. For example, if the ﬁrst player calls
out “nine,” then the range of valid numbers for the opponent is 10 to 19,
inclusive.

Question 1.20: /_387 You are to open a safe without knowing the combination. Be-
ginning with the dial set at zero, the dial must be turned counter-clockwise to
the ﬁrst combination number, (then clockwise back to zero), and clockwise to
the second combination number, (then counter-clockwise back to zero), and
counter-clockwise again to the third and ﬁnal combination number, whereupon
the door shall immediately spring open; there is no handle or key to turn. The
dial has numbers from zero to 40, and the zero is not one of the combination
numbers.
Without knowing the combination numbers, what is the maximum number of
trials required to open the safe? One trial equals one attempt to dial a full
three-number combination, and you must start again from zero for each trial.

Question 1.21: (**) You are given a set of scales and 90 coins (this question is
similar to Question 1.6). The scales are of the old balance variety. That is, a
small dish hangs from each end of a rod that is balanced in the middle. The
device enables you to conclude either that the contents of the dishes weigh
the same or that the dish that falls lower has heavier contents than the other.
You must pay $100 every time you use the scales.
The 90 coins appear to be identical. In fact, 89 of them are identical, and one
is of a diﬀerent weight. Your task is to identify the unusual coin and to discard
it while minimizing the maximum possible cost of weighing.3What is your
algorithm to complete this task? What is the most it can cost to identify the
unusual coin (assuming your strategy minimizes the maximum possible cost)?
Note that the unusual coin may be heavier than the others, or it may be
lighter. You are asked to both identify it and determine whether it is heavy
or light.4
Question 1.22: (***) Suppose that the function f(z) is complex valued in the
complex plane. Suppose also that f(z) is both bounded and entire. Prove

pected cost of weighing does not necessarily minimize the maximum possible cost. This is a subtle
distinction that you should not overlook.
4Does the answer change if you must identify the coin without saying whether it is heavy or
light?

Story: A student of mine was taken to a room and asked to choose a place
to sit at a long oval-shaped table. He chose a place at random. Later the
interviewer asked why he had chosen that spot. I think the intent was to see
if he was a leader (sitting at the head) or a follower (sitting at the side).
Question 1.23: /_387 Ih a v ed r o p p e d1 0 , 0 0 0a n t sr a n d o m l yo n t oar u l e rt h a ti so n e
meter (i.e., 100 centimeters) long and oriented to point north–south. The
ants are of very small size and mass. Each ant walks at a steady pace of
one centimeter per second in a straight line parallel to the long edge of the
ruler. Their initial direction is randomly either north or south. The ants are
all from the same colony and possess an inherited vision problem: they have
peripheral vision only. This means that they can collide with each other if
they meet head on (although very small, they are large enough to collide). If
two ants do collide head on, however, then they each turn around instantly
and head back the way they came at their steady pace. With so many ants in
one small space, a single ant may experience multiple collisions before it walks
oﬀ of the ruler. So, how long must you wait to be sure that all the ants have
walked oﬀ of the ruler?
Question 1.24: /_387 You start with a single lily pad sitting on an otherwise empty
pond. You are told that the surface area of the lily pad doubles every day
and that it will take 30 days for the single lily pad to cover the surface of the
pond.6
If instead of one lily pad you start with eight lily pads (each identical in
characteristics to the original single lily pad), how many days will it take for
the surface of the pond to become covered?
Question 1.25: /_387 Another lily pad problem. There are 27 lily pads on a pond.
Each of the lily pads is one square foot in area. The pond is 6,000 square feet
in area. Each lily pad doubles its size every day. How long until the pond is
covered in lily pads?
Question 1.26: /_387 Interviewer: “Alright, you’re from MIT; you must be a quanti-
tative type of person. ” Interviewee: (conﬁdently, after a slight pause) “Yes
indeed. ” Interviewer: “Give me the decimal equivalent of13

Question 1.27: /_387 A snail is climbing up a 10-foot pole. It climbs up by three feet
every day. Each night it sleeps. While sleeping, it slides down by one foot.
When does it reach the top of the pole?

6The student who was asked this question says that his interviewer used the number 30. However,
he suggested that I use the number 3,000 to make it more complicated. What is wrong with saying
that it takes 3,000 days for the lily pad to cover the pond?

Question 1.28: /_387 A windowless room contains three identical light ﬁxtures, each
containing an identical light bulb. Each light ﬁxture is connected to one of
three switches outside of the room. Each bulb is switched oﬀ at present. You
are outside the room, and the door is closed. You may ﬂip any of the external
switches in any manner you choose. After this, you must take your hands oﬀ
the switches and then you may go into the room and do as you please (but
you will not be allowed to damage anything or touch the switches again). How
can you tell which switch goes to which light?
Question 1.29: /_387 Inside of a dark closet are ﬁve hats: three blue and two red.
Three smart men go into the closet, and each selects a hat in the dark and
places it unseen upon his head. Each man knows both that the closet con-
tains three blue hats and two red and that the other two men have the same
knowledge.
Once outside the closet, no man can see his own hat. The ﬁrst man looks
at the other two, thinks, and says, “I cannot tell what color my hat is.” The
second man hears this, looks at the other two, and says, “I cannot tell what
color my hat is either. ” The third man is blind. The blind man says, “Well, I
know what color my hat is.” What color is his hat, and how does he know?
Question 1.30: (**) Find the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder

Question 1.31: /_387 There are two motorcyclists on a single lane road. They are 25
miles apart. At a signal, they start moving toward each other with constant
speeds. The ﬁrst motorcyclist rides at 20 mph; the second rides at 30 mph.
When the signal goes oﬀ, a ﬂy on the helmet of the ﬁrst motorcyclist is startled
and starts ﬂying toward the second motorcyclist at 40 mph. When the ﬂy
reaches the second motorcyclist (now moving toward the ﬁrst), he immediately
reverses course and ﬂies back to the ﬁrst motorcyclist. When the ﬂy gets back
to the ﬁrst motorcyclist, he reverses course again. The ﬂy continues to ﬂy
backwards and forwards between the two motorcyclists until they all collide.
How many miles will the ﬂy have traveled before his life is extinguished?

guest is given a numbered key for a speciﬁc room. Before they even go upstairs,
they are all invited to a large party in the banquet hall. To gain admittance
to the hall, they have to give up their keys to a doorman. At the end of the
evening, the guests are not sober enough to recall their room numbers, so the
doorman simply hands out the keys randomly. Each guest ends up spending
the night in a random room. What is the probability that at least one guest

and Mark all have the same birthday, say, January 15, but nobody else at the
party has a matching birthday, the count of pairs is six. (See also the next
two questions.)
Question 1.37: There are 25 people at another party. One person asks every-
body to announce their birthday, and for anyone who has the same birthday
as someone else to raise a hand. How many hands do you expect to see raised?
For example, if John, Jon, Stephen, and Mark all have the same birthday,
January 15, but nobody else at the party has a matching birthday, the count
of hands is four.

Question 1.40: (**) In a certain matriarchal town, the women all believe in an
old prophecy that says there will come a time when a stranger will visit the
town and announce whether any of the men folk are cheating on their wives.
The stranger will simply say “yes” or “no,” without announcing the number
of men implicated or their identities. If the stranger arrives and makes his
announcement, the women know that they must follow a particular rule: If
on any day following the stranger’s announcement a women deduces that her
husband is not faithful to her, she must kick him out into the street at 10 am
the next day. This action is immediately observable by every resident in the
town. It is well known that each wife is already observant enough to know
whether any man (except her own husband) is cheating on his wife. However,
no woman can reveal that information to any other. A cheating husband is
also assumed to remain silent about his inﬁdelity.
The time comes, and a stranger arrives. He announces that there are cheating
men in the town. On the morning of the tenth day following the stranger’s
arrival, some unfaithful men are kicked out into the street for the ﬁrst time.
How many of them are there?

tells the king that one tax collector is cheating and giving coins that are
consistently 10% lighter than they should be, but he does not know which
collector is cheating. The king knows that each coin should weigh exactly one
ounce. How can the king identify the cheat by using a weighing device exactly
once? (I have seen the same question asked with 10 pill bottles, nine of which

respectively. (In fact, the original question did not mention a clock, but I
think it makes for a clear mental image.) The host holds a prize. He will
pass the prize to someone seated next to him. Then that person will pass it
to someone seated next to him, and so on. The host, or any guest, is equally
likely to pass the prize clockwise or counter-clockwise. The last guest to touch
the prize wins it. (That is, the 11th guest to lay hands upon the prize gets to
keep it.) Which hour of the clock should you sit at to have the highest chance

sic option pricing theory. I strongly recommend my book Basic Black-Scholes:
Option Pricing and Trading (Crack [2021]) as the best resource. It provides a
ﬁrm foundation in Black-Scholes option pricing, with practical advice about op-
tion trading. See the advertisement at the end of this book, or go directly to
www.BasicBlackScholes.com .S o l u t i o n sf o rt h i sc h a p t e ra p p e a ri nA p p e n d i xB .
Question 2.1: All Black-Scholes assumptions hold. Assume no dividends. The
stock price is $100. The riskless interest rate is 5% per annum. Consider a
one-year European call option struck at-the-money (i.e., strike equals current
spot). If the volatility is zero (i.e., σ=0 ) ,w h a ti st h ec a l lw o r t h ? A f t e r
valuing the call, please tell me how to hedge the call (assuming you sold it).
Question 2.2: Two standard options have exactly the same features, except that
one has long maturity, and the other has short maturity. Which one has the
higher gamma?
Question 2.3: All Black-Scholes assumptions hold. Assume no dividends. Con-
sider a standard European call and a standard European put on the same
stock. Assume that each option has the same maturity, and is struck at-the-
money (i.e., strike equals current spot). For the sake of simplicity, assume that
the interest rate is zero. Draw the payoﬀ diagrams for each option (i.e., ter-
minal payoﬀ to option versus level of underlying).
The put has limited upside potential and no downside; the call has unlimited
upside potential and no downside. Given the random direction of the stock
price movements between now and expiration, the disparity in potential payoﬀs
seems to suggest that the call should be worth more than the put. However,
put-call parity says that this is not so. Verify the put-call parity implications
and reconcile them with the seemingly disparate potential payoﬀs.
Question 2.4: For a standard European call option, draw the graph of the “delta”
as a function of current stock price, S(t).
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 64 All Rights Reserved WorldwideQuestion 2.5: Assume a Black-Scholes world without dividends. Consider a
standard European call struck at-the-money (i.e., strike equals current spot)
with one year to maturity. If the interest rate is r=0.06, is the option’s delta
greater or less than 0.5? What does it depend on?
Question 2.6: Assume a Black-Scholes world with continuous dividends. Con-
sider a standard European call struck at-the-money (i.e., strike equals current
spot) with one year to maturity. If the interest rate is r=0.06, and dividends
are at rate ρ=0.03, can you tell whether the option’s delta is greater or less
than 0.5? What does it depend on?
Question 2.7: You are long a call option on MITCO stock. You have delta
hedged your position. You hear on the radio that the CEO of MITCO has
just been arrested for running a massive Ponzi scheme. The stock price plunges
$10. How do you adjust your hedge (qualitatively)? That is, do you borrow
and buy stock or sell stock and lend? Explain carefully.
Question 2.8: How do you calculate an option’s delta?1
Question 2.9: Explain very carefully the terms N(d1)a n d N(d2)t h a ta p p e a r
in the standard Black-Scholes European call option pricing formula without
dividends.2
Question 2.10: Consider the European digital option (or “binary option”) that
pays a constant Hif the stock price is above strike price Xat expiration and
zero otherwise. What is the price of this option, and how is it related to the
price of the standard Black-Scholes European call option? Explain carefully.3
Question 2.11: Consider the European digital option (or “binary option”) that
pays Hif the stock price is above strike price Xat expiration and zero oth-
erwise. How does the price of this option vary with volatility (that is, what is
∂C
∂σ2)? Intuitively? Rigorously? Explain carefully.
Question 2.12: Compare the “delta” of a standard European call option with
the delta of a barrier option, for example a “down-and-out” call option.4
1Answer for a standard European call option (with and without dividends), and for an option
with no closed-form solution (e.g., a plain vanilla American-style put or an exotic).
2Now use this explanation to deduce the standard Black-Scholes European put option pricing
formula—if you can. Conﬁrm that the pricing formulae verify the put-call parity relationship (with
D= 0): S(t)+p(t)=c(t)+Xe−r(T−t)+D.
3This is the “cash-or-nothing” digital option. You should also be able to answer this question for
the “asset-or-nothing” digital option (which gives you the asset if S(T)>Xand nothing otherwise).
4Is the answer diﬀerent for an up-and-out call? Explain carefully. Incidentally, who would buy
an up-and-out call? Well, suppose you expect only limited upside on a security. If you wish to
participate in this upside without paying for what you consider to be very unlikely further price
appreciation, then an up-and-out-call could be just what you want (see Derman and Kani [1993,
pp. 3–4]).

Question 2.13: (**) This is an applied theoretical option pricing problem taken
from a telephone interview. You are given three time series of continuously
compounded returns on an industry sector index: the ISI50. The time series
are daily, weekly, and monthly over the same time period.5You are to price

ther investigation reveals that these diﬀerences are highly statistically signiﬁ-
cant. Your statistical observation is thus that the monthly volatility implicit
in the daily and weekly time series is signiﬁcantly smaller than the monthly
volatility in the monthly time series.
How do you price the option? Explain your reasoning carefully.6
Story: One of my students went to an interview with a big-name Wall Street
ﬁrm in New York. He was interviewed by ﬁve quantitative guys in a row.
Each interview was one hour, and there were absolutely no breaks. He had to
work through multiple quantitative problems on their blackboard. They gave
him no lunch. He was exhausted and starving by the end. He was swearing
black and blue about the “&@!#@$%’s” when he got back. He said “The
Russian” was the worst.
Question 2.14: Consider a plain vanilla American call option on a non-dividend-
paying stock. The price of the call is C(t)a tt i m e t. The “intrinsic value”
of the call is max[ S(t)−X,0] (where S(t) is stock price at time t,a n d Xis
exercise price). The excess of call value over intrinsic value is the “time value”
of the option.7
Draw a graph of the time value, C(t)−max[ S(t)−X,0], versus S(t). Explain
carefully the diﬀerent aspects of the plot.
5Feel free to assume that one week is exactly ﬁve days, one month is exactly 20 days, and that
there are no missing observations or exchange holidays.
6Hint: Begin by explaining how and why your statistical observations could arise. What went
wrong? Ask yourself whether Black-Scholes pricing is still applicable. If not, where do you turn?
7Perhaps a more natural deﬁnition of intrinsic value is max[ S(t)−Xe−r(T−t),0] (Merton [1973,
p. 145]; Merton [1992, p. 260]; Smith [1976, p. 11]). What would the plot of time value versus S(t)
look like with this deﬁnition of intrinsic value?
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 66 All Rights Reserved WorldwideQuestion 2.15: It is 10 months since you sold a one-year European call option
to a customer. You have been delta-hedging your exposure to the written call
since it was sold. The option is now well in-the-money, and the delta of your
replicating portfolio is correspondingly high (at around 0.90, say).
Suppose that you watch the underlying stock price falling gently over the last
two months of the life of the option. As the stock price falls over this time
period, what happens to the delta of the replicating portfolio? That is, are
you buying stocks or selling stocks as you watch the stock price fall? You may
have to describe diﬀerent possible scenarios—be clear on the assumptions you
make.

Question 2.16: What do you know about jump processes and jump diﬀusion
processes? Explain when the pricing formula for a call option written on an
asset whose price level follows a jump process can and cannot be derived using
the Black-Scholes/Merton no-arbitrage technique.8
Question 2.17: This question concerns the standard European call option on a
non-dividend-paying stock. You are asked to draw three closely related graphs
as follows:
1. Please draw the graph of call price at maturity (time T) versus terminal
stock price, S(T).
2. Please draw the graph of call price at time tversus the futures price
F(t, T). The futures price F(t, T) is observed at time t, prior to maturity.
The futures contract and the option both mature at the same date T.9
3. Now draw the graph of call price versus stock price at time t,p r i o rt o
maturity.
Explain carefully the relationships between the three graphs.
8Describe the form of the pricing formula for a European call option written on a stock whose
price level follows a jump diﬀusion process (using Merton’s notation):dS
S=(α−λk)dt+σdZ+dq,
where dq= 0 if the “Poisson event” (i.e., the jump) does not occur, dq=(Y−1) if the jump does
occur, ( Y−1) is a spike producing a ﬁnite jump in stock price from StoSY,αis the instantaneous
expected rate of return on the stock, σ2is the instantaneous variance of returns assuming no jump
occurs, dZis a standard Wiener process, λis the number of arrivals that you expect per unit time,
k≡E(Y−1) where Eis the expectation operator over the random variable Y, and dZis assumed
independent of the Poisson process dq(see Merton [1992, p. 313]).

Question 2.18: Consider two European call options on the same underlying
stock. The options have the same strike price. Assume constant interest
rates. One option matures in one year; the other option matures in four years.
Suppose that you put σ=1 5 %i n t ot h eB l a c k - S c h o l e sf o r m u l at ov a l u et h e
one-year option. What value of σdo you put into the Black-Scholes formula to
value the four-year option? Assume that you set T−t= 1 in the Black-Scholes
formula in both cases (i.e., one unit of time equals four years in the second
case but only one year in the ﬁrst case).
Story: Some recent questions include “What do you think an investment
banker does?” Not only that, but “Do you understand the hours investment
bankers work and why?” Some of these folks look like Hell when you meet
them. Are you sure about this career choice?
Question 2.19: (***) The Black-Scholes formula is derived assuming the stock
price process S(t) follows a geometric Brownian motion: dS(t)=µS(t)dt+

interest rate r=0 ,a n dt h a tt h es t o c kp a y sn od i v i d e n d s .
Question 2.20: Interviewer: “You are fully familiar with Black-Scholes pricing
aren’t you?” Interviewee: (conﬁdently, after a slight pause) “Yes indeed. ”
Interviewer: “What is the value of a three-month at-the-money (i.e., S=X)
call option on a $100 stock when the implied vol is 40? Please assume r=0
(it is the least important ingredient anyway) and assume also that the stock
pays no dividends. You have 10 seconds to perform the calculation in your
head. Now tell me how your answer changes if it is instead a put.”

call option. You quote $100. He calls back a minute later and wants a quote
on the same option but with 200 days to maturity. How does the second price
quote compare with the ﬁrst price quote? Explain carefully.
Question 2.22: Assume a Black-Scholes world. You have a one-year European
call option on a stock. There are no dividends, the interest rate is assumed
to be zero, and the option is struck at-the-money (i.e., strike equals current
spot). The current spot is $100. The standard deviation of terminal stock
price (conditional on current stock price) is $10.10Is the call price closer to
$1, $5, or $10?11
10It follows that the standard deviation of continuously compounded returns is approximately
10% per annum.
11If the standard deviation is $20 per annum, is the call price closer to $5, $10, or $20?
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 68 All Rights Reserved WorldwideQuestion 2.23: You hold a 100-day European call option on a stock with implied
volatility 20. Suppose that you know right now that tomorrow the implied
volatility will increase to 25, but that after that it will return to 20 for the
remainder of its life. What extension to the life of the call would produce the
same change in the present value of the call as the above-mentioned single-day
increase in volatility (assuming a constant implied volatility at 20)? That is,
other things being equal, what change in the term to maturity is equivalent
to the quoted one-day change in the implied volatility? Explain carefully.
Question 2.24: You are long a straddle with a strike of $25. The underlying is
at $25. The straddle costs you $5 to enter. What price movement are you
looking for in the underlying?
Question 2.25: You are considering two contracts: a Eurodollar futures con-
tract, with six months to maturity, selling at 5%, settled on three-month LI-
BOR, marked-to-market every day; and a Eurodollar forward contract, with
six months to maturity, selling at 5%, settled on three-month LIBOR at ma-
turity.12
1. Which contract do you prefer (or are you indiﬀerent)?
2. Do you think there is a mis-pricing?
3. If you go long one and short the other, which one should be long, and
which one should be short (or are you indiﬀerent)?
Question 2.26: You are to value a call option using Monte-Carlo simulation. Is
it better to simulate the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) process for the
call itself, or the GBM process for the underlying?
Question 2.27: Suppose that you hold a long position in mortgage-backed secu-
rities. If you are expecting a bond market rally, would you be better oﬀ with
positive convexity or negative convexity?
Story: There is the old story of the candidate who ﬂew to London for an
interview. At the interview, the interviewer excused himself for a few min-
utes. However, before leaving he asked the interviewee to open a window.
Once alone, the interviewee discovered that all the windows were sealed shut.
Great! Michael Lewis (in his excellent book Liar’s Poker )t a l k sa b o u tt h i s
technique in use on Wall Street (Lewis, 1990, p. 27). He suggests that one
desperate interviewee threw a chair through Lehman’s 43rd ﬂoor window in
Manhattan!
Question 2.28: What is wrong with the following strategy for hedging a short
call option: buy one share if the stock price exceeds the strike, and sell the
share if the stock price falls below the strike?
12Note: LIBOR is due to be retired after 2021 (Riquier, 2019), but an extension to mid-2023 is

path includes a fall in price below the down barrier (i.e., the option is “knocked
in”); second, the stock price path does not include a rise in price above the up
barrier (i.e., the option is not “knocked out”); and third, the option is exercised
when the stock price is above the strike (i.e., the option is in-the-money at
exercise). This option is both path-dependent and American-style. Is there
an easy technique for valuing the option?
Question 2.39: Suppose gold prices follow a Gaussian process.15The current
price of gold is $400. The riskless interest rate is zero. The volatility of gold
in dollar terms is σ=$ 6 0p e ra n n u m . W h a ti st h ev a l u et o d a yo fad i g i t a l
cash-or-nothing option that pays $1 million in six months if the price of gold
is at or above $430?
Story: Here is another Fermi problem from Section 5.5: “How many ping-
pong balls can you ﬁt in a jumbo jet (e.g., Boeing 747)?”
Question 2.40: (**) What is the value of a perpetual (i.e., potentially inﬁnitely
lived) American put option?
Question 2.41: Let “ L”d e n o t et h et h r e e - m o n t hU . S .d o l l a rL I B O Rr a t e .16Con-
sider an interest rate swap arrangement where Party A pays Lto Party B,
and Party B pays 24% −2×Lto Party A. Can you reverse engineer this deal
and express it in simpler terms?
Question 2.42: If an option is at-the-money, about how many shares of stock
should you hold to hedge the option?
Question 2.43: Compare the price of an option on a stock if the stock price
follows mean reversion versus if the stock price does not.
Question 2.44: When can hedging an options position make you take on more
risk?
15This is an arithmetic Brownian motion. The future price of gold is thus assumed to be normally
distributed (not lognormally as per Black-Scholes).
16Note: As mentioned already, LIBOR is due to be retired after 2021 (Riquier, 2019), but an
extension to mid-2023 is likely (Shaw, McCormick, Bolingbroke, and Torres, 2020).

Question 2.45: How do you hedge a written put on a stock if you can neither
short any stock nor use options on any stock?
Question 2.46: Another pizza question! You order a pizza for six people. The
diameter of the pizza is 12 inches. What would the diameter have to be to
feed eight people? Yes, this is a derivatives question.
Question 2.47: When do you want to be short a put option on IBM stock?
Question 2.48: You own two pieces of land—a huge ﬁeld in Arizona and a tiny
piece of beach in Florida. The ﬁeld in Arizona is idle; you have no plans to
develop the land in any way. The tiny beach in Florida is very popular. In
fact, it is so popular that you charge a small entrance fee for beachgoers.
The government has oﬀered to buy the Arizona ﬁeld for $1 million. Your
neighbor has oﬀered to buy the Florida beach for $1 million as well. Other
things being equal, which piece of land has the higher forward price?
Question 2.49: You have 30 days of “representative” stock price data. How do
you calculate historical volatility ˆ σ2to use in Black-Scholes?
Question 2.50: Suppose a “top issuer” (i.e., highest-rated ﬁnancial institution
used as a reference in setting the swap curve) issues a corporate bond for
itself valued at 100. The issuer then re-prices this bond using the swap curve.
What price do they get (100, above 100, or below 100)? To clarify, they ﬁx the
coupon rate of the bond so that it is priced at par, and then they try pricing
this same bond by discounting those previously set coupons using the swap
curve. Is the answer par, above par, or below par?
Question 2.51: Suppose I don’t know any mathematics. How do you explain to
me why you use the riskless rate instead of the required return on the stock
to derive the Black-Scholes formula?
Question 2.52: Are you better oﬀ using implied standard deviation or historical
standard deviation to forecast volatility?
Question 2.53: According to Black-Scholes, which is more valuable: a European
call option that is 10% out-of-the-money, or a European put option that is
10% out-of-the-money?
Question 2.54: Why are theta and gamma of opposite signs? Are they always
of opposite signs?
Question 2.55: Suppose that the riskless rate is zero. Suppose that a stock is at
$100, and one year from now will be at either $130, or $70, with probabilities
0.80 and 0.20 respectively. There are no dividends. What is the value of a
one-year European call with strike $110?
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 72 All Rights Reserved WorldwideQuestion 2.56: (**) Find a formula for the European-style “product call” with
payoﬀ max( S1×S2−X,0),where S1andS2are the prices of assets following
geometric Brownian motions with correlated random increments. All other
Black-Scholes assumptions apply.
Question 2.57: Are Asian options cheaper or more expensive than plain vanilla
European-style options?
Story: One of my students was asked to “Describe the best party you have
ever been to. ” She said this big-name Wall Street investment bank was looking
for “fun loving” people.
Question 2.58: When can a plain vanilla American-style call be treated as a
European-style one? When can a plain vanilla American-style put be treated
as a European-style one?
Question 2.59: How many nodes are there in a recombining binomial tree with
Ntime steps? How many nodes are there in a non-recombining binomial tree
with Ntime steps?
Question 2.60: You have inside information that a foreign stock will rise for
sure. You can legally trade in the foreign market without being subject to any
insider trading rules. You can trade the stock, a forward on the stock, futures
on the stock, or options on the stock. Assume interest rates are zero, there
are no transactions costs, the exchange rate will not move, and there are no
restrictions on trading the derivatives. What trade should you put on if you
can only go long these instruments?
Question 2.61: (**) A call option is priced at ctoday. What is its expected
price tomorrow?
Question 2.62: (**) If in Question 2.61 you answered that the expected call
price tomorrow is higher than today’s call price, then how do you reconcile
your answer with time decay? That is, how do you reconcile a positive expected
return with negative theta?

Other Financial Economics
Questions
As a prerequisite to answering the questions in this chapter, it is expected that
you have completed an introductory course in ﬁnancial economics (or equivalent
independent study). You also need a good deal of common sense. Solutions for this
chapter appear in Appendix C.
Question 3.1: Consider the following game: a player tosses a fair coin until a
head appears; if the head occurs on the kthtoss, the player gets a payoﬀ of
$2k,a n dt h eg a m ee n d s .1
1. What is the fair value of the game? That is, what is the expected payoﬀ
to a player?
2. A very important customer is on the line and wants you to quote him a
bid-ask spread for exactly one play of the game. “Hurry up, I haven’t
got all day!” You have 15 seconds.
Question 3.2: If the standard deviation of continuously compounded annual
stock returns is 10%, what is the standard deviation of continuously com-
pounded four-year stock returns?
Question 3.3: /_387 From the term-structure of interest rates, you see that the ﬁve-
year spot rate is 10% per annum and the 10-year spot rate is 15% per annum.
What is the implied forward rate from year 5 to year 10?
Question 3.4: /_387 Explain carefully the diﬀerence between the “yield” on a bond
and the “rate of return” on a bond.
Question 3.5: What is “chaos theory”? Can you use it to predict stock returns?
If so, how?
1This game is over 250 years old and is known as the “St. Petersburg Game. ” It is quoted by
Daniel Bernoulli ([Latin version 1738]; [English translation 1954]).
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 74 All Rights Reserved WorldwideQuestion 3.6: /_387 Draw the graph of bond price versus yield-to-maturity. Why is
the curve convex?2
Question 3.7: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) says that the plot of
E(r)v e r s u s βis an upward sloping line through (0 ,rf)a n d[ 1 ,E(rM)] (i.e., the
Security Market Line [SML]). Suppose, however, that when you plot average
returns against estimated betas you ﬁnd something else. Which of the follow-
ing two scenarios is most likely?
1. An upward sloping curve beginning at (0, rf), wholly above the theo-
retical SML, initially more steep than the SML, but eventually roughly
parallel to the SML
2. An upward sloping curve beginning at (0, rf), wholly below the theo-
retical SML, initially less steep than the SML, but eventually roughly
parallel to the SML
Which CAPM assumptions (if any) are violated by the above two scenarios?
Question 3.8: /_387 From the term-structure of interest rates, you see that the two-
year spot rate is 7.60% per annum, and the one-year spot rate is 7.15% per
annum.
What is the implied forward rate for the second year?
Question 3.9: Consider a six-month forward contract on a 10-year riskless dis-
count (zero-coupon) bond.
1. Is the bond selling at a forward premium or a forward discount?
2. Does your answer change if the bond is a riskless coupon bond (assume
the coupon rate exceeds the current risk-free rate)?
Question 3.10: You believe that the yield curve is going to steepen very soon. It
may be a fall in short-term rates, a rise in long-term rates, or some combination
of these. What strategy should you pursue in the bond market to position
yourself to proﬁt from your beliefs?
Question 3.11:/_387Deﬁne “duration” and “convexity. ” Describe their properties and
uses.
Question 3.12: Describe brieﬂy the GARCH(1,1) model in qualitative terms.
Now write down the formal GARCH(1,1) model and explain each term care-
fully.3
Question 3.13:/_387You have a long position in a $100 million 30-year bond. What
can you do to limit your exposure to only $50 million?
2Can you give economic intuition for this convexity? What about mathematical intuition?
3Note that GARCH is an acronym for Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedas-
ticity. How do you estimate the model? Why was it introduced?
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 75 All Rights Reserved WorldwideCHAPTER 3. OTHER FINANCIAL ECONOMICS QUESTIONS
Question 3.14: (**) You hold an 8% coupon, 30-year, $1,000 par, Mexican
Brady bond. Interest rates in Mexico do not change. Interest rates in the
U.S. increase by 1%. What is the change in the price of your bond? Make any
necessary assumptions.
Question 3.15: You construct a yield curve for (coupon-bearing) treasuries. A
particular ﬁve-year corporate zero-coupon bond has a default risk premium
of 1% over the level of your treasuries yield curve at the ﬁve-year mark. You
believe that the yield curve is going to ﬂatten in such a way that the default
risk premium of the ﬁve-year corporate zero remains constant (short-term
rates rise, long-term rates fall, and the yield on the ﬁve-year coupon-bearing
treasury and ﬁve-year corporate zero remain unchanged).
What strategy should you pursue using the ﬁve-year zero-coupon corporate
bond and treasuries to position yourself to proﬁt from your beliefs?
Question 3.16: The ﬁve-year interest rate is 10%, and the 10-year interest rate
is 15%. You conclude that the forward rate from year 5 to year 10 is approx-
imately 20%. Explain, using plain English ,w h yt h ef o r w a r dr a t eh a st ob e
higher than the 20% approximate value mentioned above.
Question 3.17: /_387 Here is a simple game. You get to toss a fair coin now. If it
is heads, you get seven dollars 18 months from now. If it is tails, you lose
two dollars immediately. The one-year interest rate is 12% per annum. The
two-year interest rate is 18% per annum.
How much are you prepared to pay to play this game?
Story: Many people are asked: “Are you married? What religion are you?
Do you have children? What does your spouse do? How is your family?
Where were you born? How old are you?” These are legal questions in the
U.S., but discriminating on the basis of the answers is not legal. So, most
employers avoid even the hint of possible discrimination. Nevertheless, you
should be prepared to answer these questions.
Question 3.18: There are 20 traders in a room. They trade in 100 stocks. They
trade for their own accounts and only amongst themselves—it is a “closed
economy.” Halfway through their morning trading session, a group of SEC
oﬃcials arrives and announces that one of the traders has inside information
on one stock and has been trading on it. The trader is not yet identiﬁed. The
SEC oﬃcials seat themselves in the room to watch. What happens to trading
volume after the SEC announcement? Explain carefully.
Story: One of my students who got a job at a large mutual fund company
described his ﬁrm’s working environment as follows: “Dig a hole, ﬁll the hole
with water, ﬁll the water with sharks, and promote anything that crawls out
alive. ”
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 76 All Rights Reserved WorldwideQuestion 3.19: Two stocks have the same expected return. One has standard
deviation of returns of 20%, and the other has standard deviation of returns of
30%. The correlation between their returns is 50%. How do I allocate money
between these so as to minimize my risk.
Question 3.20: The same question as Question 3.19 but with variance of returns
10% and 40%, respectively, and correlation 50%.
Story: Let me give some unorthodox advice.
1.A colleague and I were interviewing a candidate for a quant equi-
ties job in London. After a few questions about his CV, we asked him
as i m p l eq u a n tq u e s t i o n . H ew a se x t r e m e l yu n c o m f o r t a b l e . H ed e c l a r e d
it to be “not a proper interview,” and to our amazement, he walked out
the door! He made two fatal mistakes. First, walking out meant he was
aq u i t t e r . N o b o d yl i k e sq u i t t e r s . S e c o n d ,h es h o u l dh a v ea t t e m p t e da n
answer because even if he was not suited to quant equities at my ﬁrm, we
had vacancies in other areas and we knew of vacancies at other ﬁrms, and
we would have passed his CV on if we thought he was talented—but not
if we thought he was a quitter. It is in the interviewer’s best interests to
pass good CVs around the ﬁrm and to a network of contacts outside of it
because the favor will be returned eventually. Remember, you are never
interviewing for that one job only! If the interview is going badly, then be
positive and focus on your strengths even if they are not strengths for that job!
2.I was being interviewed for a practitioner job I really wanted. I
was up to about the ﬁfth person on my schedule for the day. From the
moment this guy set eyes on me across the table I could tell he did not want
to hire me. He was 100% negative and actually looked angry! I can read
upside down, and, without him noticing, I quickly read the questions he
had written on my CV across the table from me. I addressed his questions
before he even asked them. That surprised him! I turned the conversation
toward the markets and found some common ground. He became interested.
I made a tasteful joke. He smiled. When our half-hour was up, he
was 100% positive and I know he recommended that I be hired. There
was nothing unethical about this manipulation of interview/interviewer: I
love the markets, wanted the job, and thought the ﬁrm was a great ﬁt for me.
3.The two stories above are about losing and winning, respectively.
I think a diﬀerence between these outcomes is mental preparation. I was
given an inexpensive book called The Dirty Dozen written by Sergeant
Major (Ret.) Lawrence A. Jordan. Sergeant Major Jordan served a 24-year
Special Operations career with the U.S. Army Rangers and Special Forces.
His book is about dirty ﬁghting techniques, and Chapter 2, “The Winning
Mind,” is about mental preparation for life-or-death hand-to-hand combat
in self defence. Although it is unorthodox of me to write this, I recommend
that you read “The Winning Mind” chapter of The Dirty Dozen for interview
preparation. If you can stomach it, it may give you just the edge you need.

Statistics Questions
The only prerequisites for answering the statistics questions in this chapter are
elementary statistical skills. Solutions for this chapter appear in Appendix D.
Question 4.1: A breakfast cereal company gives away a free toy in each box of
cereal. There are four diﬀerent toys. How many boxes do you expect to have
to buy in order to get all four toys?
Question 4.2: Suppose we draw two random numbers XandYeach distributed
uniform on the interval [0 ,1]. If XandYare independent, what is the prob-
ability that their product is greater than 1/2?
Question 4.3: Suppose that X∼N(µ, σ2)( i . e . , Xis normally distributed with
mean µand variance σ2). Please write down the pdf fX(x)o fX. Where does
the constant factor in the pdf come from?

Question 4.5: Suppose that XandYare independent random variables each
distributed standard normal: X∼N(0,1), and Y∼N(0,1). What are the
variance and the standard deviation of X−Y.
Question 4.6: /_387 Consider the following game. The player tosses a die once only.
The payoﬀ is $1 for each “dot” on the upturned face. Assuming a fair die, at
what level should you set the ticket price for this game?
Question 4.7: Ia mg o i n gt ot o s sf o u rc o i n s . Y o ua r eg o i n gt ot o s sﬁ v ec o i n s .
You win if you get strictly more heads than I do. What is the probability that
you win?

immediately after the ﬁrst roll, or immediately after the second, or you can
wait for the third. I will pay you the same number of dollars as there are dots

me sooner). What is your playing strategy?2
Story: One of my MIT students was exceptionally well qualiﬁed. He was
also one of the nicest guys I have ever met. He was quiet and soft-spoken.
He was very understated (the kind of guy you might not notice). His starting
salary at a big-name Wall Street ﬁrm was about four times the average MIT
starting salary that year. The moral of the story: I don’t care how hot you
think you are—brains wins.
Question 4.9: The correlation between XandYisρ.W h a t i s t h e c o r r e l a t i o n
between X+5a n d Y? What is the correlation between 5 XandY?
Story: One interviewee told me that the interviewers aim to put you under
as much pressure as possible, and that “you never know when they are going
to bring out the guy in the chicken suit. ”
Question 4.10: /_387 (**) Two sealed envelopes are handed out. You get one and
your competitor gets the other. You understand that one envelope contains
mdollars, and the other contains 2 mdollars (where mis unstated).3
1.Ifyou peek into your envelope, you see $X. However, you do not know
whether your opponent has $2 Xor $1

expected beneﬁt to switching envelopes? What is your opponent’s ex-
pected beneﬁt to switching envelopes (assuming your opponent sees $Y)?
Should you switch? If you do, do you do it again for the same reason
(assuming neither of you peeked)?
2. Suppose that you both peek into your envelopes initially. What is the
payoﬀ to switching? Should you switch? If you do, do you do it again
for the same reason?
Question 4.11: They call this the “World Series” problem in the U.S. Sports
teams “A” and “B” are to play each other until one has four wins and is
declared the series winner. You have $100 to bet on Team A to win the
series. You are, however, only allowed to bet on individual games, not the
ﬁnal outcome directly, and, you must bet a positive amount on each game.
So, if Team A wins the series, you must walk away with $200, but if Team A
loses the series, you must walk away with zero, and you must do so having
placed a non-zero bet on every game. Your best assessment is that Team A

game? Suppose instead an amended game is played: I roll a single die three times without pause,
and the payoﬀ to the player is the maximum of the three rolls. What is the expected payoﬀ to
the player? Can you tell up front whether the original or amended game has the higher expected
payoﬀ?

has a 70% chance of winning any game and Team B has a 30% chance. How
do you place your bets?
Question 4.12: /_387 You have three children, but only one apple. You want to toss
a fair coin to determine which child gets the apple. You want each child to be
equally likely to get the apple. What is your strategy?4
Question 4.13: A follow-up question to Question 4.12: What is the expected
number of tosses needed to complete this strategy?
Question 4.14: /_387 Another follow-up question to Question 4.12: You have a fair
coin and you want to simulate an event that has probability 1/3, and an
event that has probability 2/3. How do you do it?
Question 4.15: What is the expected number of tosses of an unfair coin needed
to get two heads ( HH) in a row (assume probability pof a head)? Same
question with three heads ( HHH )i nar o w .
Question 4.16: You are tossing a fair coin and writing down the outcomes. What
is the probability that you will see the sequence HTH before you see the
sequence HHT ?
Question 4.17: You are tossing a fair coin and writing down the outcomes. What
is the expected number of tosses needed to obtain the outcome HTH ?
Question 4.18: /_387 You and I are to play a game. You roll a die until a number
other than a one appears. When such a number appears for the ﬁrst time, I
pay you the same number of dollars as there are dots on the upturned face of
the die, and the game ends. What is the expected payoﬀ to this game?
Question 4.19: You are dealt exactly two playing cards from a well-shuﬄed stan-
dard 52-card deck. The standard deck contains exactly four Kings. What is
the probability that both of your cards are Kings?
Story: It is many years ago now, but I know of a well-qualiﬁed MIT student
who got a job oﬀer of $X from a well-known ﬁrm (a good oﬀer at that time).
He declined, telling them that they had misjudged him. They called him
back a couple of days later and oﬀered him $ X×1.67 instead! Amazing! He
took the job.
Question 4.20: /_387 (**) This is one version of the famous “Let’s Make a Deal” or
“Monty Hall” game show question. It is your turn to be on a weekly game
show. There are three doors. You know that there is a prize behind one of
them, and nothing behind the other two. The game show host tells you that
you shall receive whatever is behind the door of your choice. However, before

the biased coin to fairly pick which child gets the apple?

promises you that rather than immediately opening the door of your choice to
reveal its contents, he will ﬁrst open one of the other two doors to reveal that
it is empty. He will then give you the option to change your mind and instead
choose the remaining door that he did not open.
You may assume that whoever set up the doors and prizes placed the prize
uniformly randomly behind a door (i.e., each door had an equal probability
of being chosen as the prize location). You may assume that if you initially
choose a door that has the prize, then the host is uniformly random in revealing
one of the two remaining doors as empty. You may assume that the host must
reveal an empty door.5
You choose Door 3. He opens Door 2 and reveals that it is empty. You now
know that the prize lies behind either Door 3 or Door 1. Should you switch
your choice to Door 1?
Is t r o n g l yr e c o m m e n dt h a ty o un o tl o o ka tt h ea n s w e ru n t i ly o uh a v ed o n e
your best.
Question 4.21: (**) Now we will ask you the same question as the previous
one, except that when it comes time for the host to reveal an empty door,
he instead selects someone from the audience who chooses randomly and by
chance chooses a door that is revealed to be empty. Should you switch?
Note: There are two ways to interpret this question. You could assume that
the game can be played repeatedly with an audience member always revealing

member (ignorant of the prize’s location) just happens to have chosen an
empty door. Try answering both.
Story: A student interviewing with a top bulge bracket ﬁrm was asked how
he would move Mount Fuji. One of my colleagues suggested the answer “Call
Mohammed. ”
Question 4.22: You are presented with two empty jars and 100 marbles on a
table. There are 50 white marbles and 50 black marbles. You are to put all
100 of the marbles into the two jars in any way you choose. I will then blindfold
you. I will shake the jars up to ensure good mixing, and I will rearrange the
placing of the jars on the table so that you do not know which one is which.
You may then request either the “left-hand” or the “right-hand” jar. You get
to choose exactly one jar, you are allowed to withdraw at most one marble
from the jar, and you do not get a second chance if you are unhappy with your
choice.
5You can imagine variations of the problem where the host is not required to open another door
if doing so helps you, or where he does not open doors with equal likelihood. The solution may
diﬀer in those cases.

probability that your blindfolded random draw obtains a white marble?6
Question 4.23: (***) Your name is Mr. 10. You are standing in a ﬁeld with
two opponents: Mr. 30 and Mr. 60. Each of you has a gun and plenty of
ammunition. Each of you is in clear sight of the others and well within ﬁring
range. The goal is to maximize the probability of survival. Unfortunately, you
are not a very good shot. If you take a shot at one of your opponents, you
have only a 10% chance of killing him. Mr. 30 is a better shot; he has a 30%
chance of killing whomever he shoots at. Mr. 60 is even better; he has a 60%
chance of killing his target. You take turns shooting in a pre-arranged order:
ﬁrst you, then Mr. 30, then Mr. 60, and then through this cycle again and
again until only one person remains.
You get to shoot ﬁrst. At whom, if anyone, do you shoot?7
Question 4.24: Basketball! Your team is down two points, you are the best
player, and you have the ball. There are only a few seconds left before the
buzzer. You can take a shot from three-point land or move up and take one
from two-point land. Historically, you have a 40% probability of getting the
shot in from three-point land and a 70% probability of getting the shot in from
two-point land.
Should you try for the three-point shot (a certain win if you make it), or
should you try for the two-point shot? Note that a two-pointer produces a tie
and puts you into overtime. We assume your team has a ﬁfty-ﬁfty chance of
winning in overtime.
Question 4.25: Iw i l ls p i naf a i rr o u l e t t ew h e e lw i t ho n l yﬁ v es e c t i o n s . F o u ro f
the ﬁve sections pay $1; the ﬁfth pays $5.
1. If the cost is $1.50 per spin, and you may play as often as you want,
should you play the game?
2. If the cost is $1.50 per spin, and you may play exactly once, should you
play the game?
Question 4.26: If you like gambling and you like betting on the outcome of sports
matches, then you may like the “parlay card. ” A parlay card lets you bet on
the outcomes of more than one match. In order to win a parlay bet, you must
be correct on each of the matches you bet upon. Parlay cards oﬀer big payoﬀs
if you are right on every match (some even oﬀer a payoﬀ for “almost wins”).
6Can you answer the same question except that you are to minimize the probability of a white
marble? Does minimizing the probability of a white marble maximize the probability of a black
one?
7Does the answer change if the order is ﬁrst you, then Mr. 60, then Mr. 30, then you, and so
on?

against your head. Close your eyes while I pull the trigger. Click! This is your
lucky day: you are still alive! Our game diﬀers from regular Russian roulette
because I am not going to add any bullets to the barrel before we continue,
and I am not going to give you the gun.
My question for you: I am going to shoot at you once more before we talk
about your resume. Do you want me to spin the barrel once more, or should
Ij u s ts h o o t ?9
Question 4.29: You have a large jar containing 999 fair pennies and one two-
headed penny. Suppose you pick one coin out of the jar and ﬂip it 10 times
and get all heads. What is the probability that the coin you chose is the
two-headed one?
Question 4.30: /_387 Four cards are shuﬄed and placed face down in front of you.
Their faces (hidden) display the four elements: water, earth, wind, and ﬁre.
You are to turn the cards over one at a time until you either win or lose. You
win if you turn over water and earth. You lose if you turn over ﬁre. What is
the probability that you win?
Story: “In his ﬁrst meeting with me, a candidate made himself a little
toocomfortable. Not only did he liberally pepper his conversation with
profanities, he also pulled his chair right up to the edge of my desk and
started examining papers and knickknacks. ”

Russian roulette, the eﬀect of gravity on the bullet(s) will inﬂuence the position of the revolver’s

Question 4.31: Two players AandBplay a marble game. Each player has both
a red and a blue marble. They present one marble to each other. If both
present red, Awins $3. If both present blue, Awins $1. If the colors do not
match, Bwins $2. The winnings come from an external source, not from the
other player. Is it better to be A,o rB,o rd o e si tn o tm a t t e r ?

Question 4.35: In a survey of 1,000 people, 60% said they would vote for Can-
didate A for president (and 40% said they would vote for someone else). How
can you calculate a margin of error on the 60% estimate?
Question 4.36: Ad i s e a s eo c c u r sw i t hp r o b a b i l i t y0 . 5 %i nt h ep o p u l a t i o n . T h e r e
is a test for the disease. If you have the disease, the test returns a positive for
sure. If you do not have the disease, the test returns a false positive 7% of the
time. A random stranger is given the test and it returns a positive. What is
the probability that the stranger has the disease?
Question 4.37: How many diﬀerent ways can you invest $20,000 into ﬁve funds
in increments of $1,000? For example, one way to do it is
($0; $4 ,000; $1 ,000; $2 ,000; $13 ,000).

randomly to the cookie dough, and you randomly split the dough into 100
equal cookies. How many chips should go into the dough to give a probability
of at least 90% that every cookie has at least one chip?
Question 4.39: You will roll a fair die until the game stops. The game stops
when you get a 4, 5, or 6. For every number 1, 2, or 3 you have thrown
your score increases by +1. If the game stops with a 4 or 5, you get paid the
accumulated score. If the game stops with a 6 you get nothing. What is the
expected payoﬀ of this game?
Question 4.40: Take a stick and break it randomly into three pieces (i.e., two
randomly placed breaks on the stick). What is the probability you can form
a triangle from the pieces?
Question 4.41: (**)Av a r i a t i o no nt h ep r e v i o u sq u e s t i o n : W h a ti st h ee x p e c t e d

Question 4.42: Consider four boxes in a row numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. You start
with a pebble in Box 1. We toss a fair coin. If it is heads you move the pebble
forward one step to Box 2, but if it is tails you move the pebble forward two
steps to Box 3. Then we toss the coin again. If it is heads, you move the
pebble back to Box 1, but if it is tails you advance it to Box 4. If you reach
Box 4 the game is over. If you are back in Box 1, however, then we toss again
following the same rules. What is the expected number of coin tosses it will
take to reach Box 4?
Question 4.43: /_387 It e l ly o ut h a tIh a v et w oc h i l d r e na n dt h a ta tl e a s to n eo ft h e m

Question 4.46: A single fair coin is tossed until either three heads are seen or un-
til three tails are seen. The three heads or three tails need not be consecutive.
What is the expected number of tosses in the game?
Question 4.47: If the coin in Question 4.46 is biased, is the expected number of
tosses to get “three of the same” going to be greater or less than it was with
the unbiased coin?

give your answer to four decimal places, and you may not use a calculator.
Question 4.49: You are going to roll three fair dice. What is the probability that
the diﬀerence between the highest and lowest numbers showing is exactly four?
Please give the answer to three decimal places, without using a calculator.

0×P(N) with probability 0 .5.
What is the expected number of generations until extinction?
Question 4.51: There are seven coins arranged in a circle. Every coin is heads-
up. Your goal is to ﬂip every coin so that it is heads-down. You may, however,
only ﬂip groups of three adjacent coins. You may ﬂip any such group of three
coins, and you may ﬂip as many such groups as you choose, one group at a
time. What is the minimum number of groups of three coins you can ﬂip in
order to ﬂip every coin so that it is heads-down?11
Question 4.52: You are going to roll three dice. What is the probability that
the highest of the three numbers will be exactly a 4? Please give your answer
to three decimals without using a calculator.
Question 4.53: You are on vacation in a foreign country. You are sitting in a
restaurant looking out the window. Your waiter tells you that the bus service
stopping outside your restaurant window arrives as a Poisson process. As you
eat your ﬁshcakes, you pull out your stopwatch and you time two minutes
between the arrival of the ﬁrst and second bus that you see, and then 12
minutes between the second and third bus. Seven minutes passes after the
arrival of the third bus, and the fourth bus is not yet in sight. Stop now and
estimate the arrival rate λof the Poisson process.
11I have also heard of this question asked with reference to a rotating circular chandelier, with
seven illuminated light bulbs that you are trying to extinguish, and a switch that ﬂips the state of
the three nearest adjacent light bulbs. In practice, it is much easier to play with the problem at
home using coins than using light bulbs.

Question 4.55: Italy is playing the U.S.A. in a football World Cup match. A
successful pass is when a player on one team kicks the ball to a player on their
team and it is not intercepted by the opposition. Is it possible for Italy to
have a higher proportion of its passes be successful than the U.S. in both the
ﬁrst and second halves, and yet for the U.S. to have a higher proportion of its
passes be successful over the game as a whole?
Question 4.56: We are going to play a game. You have a fair coin, and your
opponent has a fair coin. You are going to toss your coins together. If the
outcome is HH, you pay $6. If the outcome is HT or TH, you receive $5. If
the outcome is TT, you pay $4. If you play this game many times, will you
win or lose money?
Question 4.57: Suppose that you can choose any probability pof a head for your
coin in Question 4.56. However, your opponent will see your choice of p,a n d
can choose his or her own probability of a head as p′in response. What pwill
you choose, and what will be the outcome of repeated play of the game?
Question 4.58: Write down the central limit theorem.
Question 4.59: Given two uncorrelated Gaussian random variables Z1andZ2,
how can you obtain two correlated Gaussian random variables X1andX2,
with correlation coeﬃcient ρ?

Non-Quantitative Questions
Poor answers to non-quantitative questions can trip you up in an interview as surely
as can poor answers to quantitative questions. If you are anything like me, you prob-
ably hate those invasive, wishy-washy, touchy-feely, namby-pamby, non-quantitative
interview questions that you cannot solve using logic or mathematics. If you have
prepared for the quantitative questions, but you are dreading those wishy-washy,
non-quantitative ones, then you need to read this chapter.
My non-quantitative questions are broken into ﬁve categories: Questions About
You, Questions About Your Job Awareness, Questions About the Markets or The
Economy, Questions About Financial Management, and “Thinking Questions.” In
cases where I deem an answer necessary, the question is labeled with an “ (A),” and
its suggested answer appears in Appendix E.
Some of these questions have a single correct answer (great!). Others are roughly
what you might expect in some sort of Freudian couch session after having been
arrested for machine-gunning all the bag boys in your local supermarket. Some of
the questions depend upon knowledge of ﬁnancial management; others depend upon
how many drinks you had at that last party you went to (and you might not get the
job if you did not have any drinks at the last party or if you do not go to parties).
Speaking of which, I saw a guy turn up to an interview wearing white shoes and a
white jacket. He looked like he was arriving for 1970’s disco.
5.1 Questions about You
Question 5.1.1: /_387 Describe yourself in one word. (I was tempted to say “concise!”)
Question 5.1.2: /_387 Tell me about yourself.
Question 5.1.3: /_387 Walk me through your resume.

Question 5.1.6: /_387 What are your career goals? How will you achieve those goals?
Question 5.1.7: /_387 What do you see yourself doing in ﬁve years? Is this diﬀerent
from what you imagined when you entered the degree program at your college
(if so, how so)?

your preferences. Whatever you reveal should be part of your sales pitch to
the interviewer. If I answer that “I like my corner oﬃce with the view” or “I
like being able to close my oﬃce door so nobody can talk to me,” then I make
myself look bad.
Question 5.1.13: /_387 What is your primary motivation in seeking a new role?
Question 5.1.14: /_387 What do you dislike about your current job? Like the last
question, be careful. This is not about your current job. If you say “My boss
is an idiot” or “I have been treated unfairly,” it makes you look bad.
Question 5.1.15: /_387 What are your expectations for this internship (or job)?
Question 5.1.16: /_387 What did you do, and what did you learn, at your investment
banking internship?

place to sit at a long oval-shaped table. He chose a place at random. Later
the interviewer asked why he had chosen that spot. I think the intent was to
see if he was a leader (sitting at the head) or a follower (sitting at the side).
Question 5.1.41: /_387 What are the character traits of a follower? What about a
leader? Are you a follower or a leader? How do you motivate others?
Question 5.1.42: /_387 Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a highly
ambiguous situation. What did you do? How did you deal with it?

and how have you dealt with it?
Question 5.1.62: /_387 How much of your education did you personally fund?
Question 5.1.63: /_387 How do you spend your time outside of school and work? How
do you balance your life?
Question 5.1.64: /_387 Describe your typical day.

hard? Do you work more or less than your peers who get the same grades?
Question 5.1.66: /_387 Describe a situation where you had to process information.
Question 5.1.67: /_387 From a candidate: “I was then taken to a more casual room
where I met two of the young analysts and just had a chat that was ‘oﬀ the
record,’ but it was quite reassuring and a good way to establish some rapport.”
Note that nothing is ever oﬀ the record during an interview.
Question 5.1.68: /_387 At interview end: “Is there anything important you have not
had a chance to tell me?”
Question 5.1.69: /_387 At interview end: “You now have two minutes to add any
further comments you may have. ” This is your time to address any misconcep-
tions or mistakes, or to ask questions. It is not a time to remain silent (see
my related comments on the next question).
Question 5.1.70: At interview end: “Do you have any questions you would like
to ask me?” Candidates with no questions appear unmotivated/uninterested.
Saying no is like slapping your interviewer in the face. Your questions must
be ones whose answers cannot be found easily online. For example, “Do you
have any reservations about hiring me that we can discuss right now?,” “What
challenges will your division face over the next year?,” or “Why did you join
the company?,” or “What do you ﬁnd most satisfying about working here?” or
“What is the best advice you can give me to achieve long-run success here?”

years (Fama and French [1992, 1993]) but gives excellent intuition for the CAPM. Watch out for
the use of a riskless rate of 10% per annum and an expected return on the market of 19% per

Purely Quantitative & Logic
Answers
This appendix contains answers to the questions posed in Chapter 1.
Answer 1.1: This question has appeared over and over again. Although simple,
it is rarely answered well. No calculation is required to determine the answer.
If you used anyalgebra whatsoever, stop now, go back, reread the question,
and try again.
When the quantity Qof water is poured into the alcohol jug, the concentration
of alcohol in the alcohol jug becomesV
V+Q.A f t e r m i x i n g a n d p o u r i n g s o m e
back, the concentration of alcohol in the alcohol jug does not change again
(because no new water is added). However, when the diluted alcohol is poured
back into the water jug, the concentration of water in the water jug changes
from 100% toV
V+Q.T h a ti s ,t h eﬁ n a lc o n c e n t r a t i o n sa r ei d e n t i c a l .
How do you see that the ﬁnal concentrations must be identical? Remember,
you do not need any calculations at all. In fact, the only reason for any
calculation is if you also want to ﬁnd out what the ﬁnal concentrations are
(you were not asked this, but if you wish to work it out, your calculations need
not go beyond those of the previous paragraph).
Here is how it works. At the end of the process, both jugs contain the same
volume of ﬂuid as they did at the start. The only way for the concentration
of alcohol (for example) to have changed from 100% is if some alcohol was
displaced by water. Similarly, the only way for the concentration of water to
have changed from 100% is if some water was displaced by alcohol. Volume is
conserved (both total volume and volume in each jug), so all that has happened
is that identical quantities of water and alcohol have traded places (and these
identical quantities are slightly less than Q). By symmetry, the concentrations
of alcohol in the alcohol jug and water in the water jug must be identical. This
ﬁnal result is true no matter how many times you repeat the experiment.
If you are still stuck, here is another way of thinking about it. Imagine a
black bucket with 1,000 black marbles in it and a white bucket with 1,000
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 102 All Rights Reserved Worldwidewhite marbles in it. Suppose I take 100 black marbles out of the black bucket
and put them in the white bucket and mix it up really well. Then I have
1,100 marbles in the white bucket, and the great majority of them are white.
Suppose I then take 100 marbles from those 1,100 and use them to top the
black bucket back up to 1,000 marbles. Then both buckets have 1,000 marbles
again. Let us suppose that 91 (i.e., the great majority) of the 100 marbles used
to top up the black bucket were white. That means I must have returned only
9o ft h eo r i g i n a l1 0 0b l a c km a r b l e sb a c kt ot h eb l a c kb u c k e tw h e nIt o p p e d
it up. That means I must have left 91 black marbles behind in the white
bucket—the same as the number of white marbles that migrated over to the
black bucket. So, the proportions are identical!
Answer 1.2: I give three successively shorter solutions. The ﬁrst is a hammer-
and-tongs solution that lays everything out in detail. The second is more
elegant, and the third is more elegant still. Each solution brings something
slightly diﬀerent to the table.
FIRST SOLUT ION
LetDbe the number of steps showing on the escalator at any moment ( D
for distance, counted in units of one step). Let ebe the (assumed constant)
speed of the escalator, in steps per second. Let vMbe Myron’s relative speed
of ascent up the escalator (which is the same whether the steps are moving or
not). If vM= 0, then Myron will climb zero steps under his own steam. If
vM=∞,t h e nM y r o nw i l lc l i m b Dsteps. So, it will be the relative diﬀerences
in speed that let us identify D.
Myron’s absolute speed up the incline holding the escalator is e+vM.S o ,
Myron must cover the distance Din time tM, spent on the escalator, as given
by Equation A.1.
tM=D/(e+vM) (A.1)
How many steps does Myron climb in time tM?W e l l , a t s p e e d vM,w ej u s t
need to multiply time taken by speed, as in Equation A.2.
steps climbed (Myron) = tM·vM=DvM/(e+vM) (A.2)
We should double check that the RHS of Equation A.2 conforms to our intu-
ition. If we plug vM= 0 into Equation A.2 we get zero steps, as expected, for
anye>0. Similarly, if we take the limit of Equation A.2 as vM→∞,w eg e t
Dsteps, for any e≥0.
Now let vFdenote Fischer’s slower speed, where 2 vM=3vF.T h e n , f r o m
Equation A.2 and the relative speeds, we have Equations A.3–A.5.
steps climbed (Myron) = 25 = DvM/(e+vM) (A.3)
steps climbed (Fischer) = 20 = DvF/(e+vF) (A.4)
2vM=3 vF (A.5)
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 103 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAPPENDIX A. PURELY QUANTITATIVE & LOGIC ANSWERS
Now multiply Equation A.3 by the RHS denominator, and rewrite Equa-
tion A.5 as vM=1.5vF,a n dp l u gi ti n t ot h er e s u l t . T h e nm u l t i p l yE q u a -
tion A.4 through by its RHS denominator and multiply the result by 1.25, to
get the equations
D(1.5vF)=2 5 e+2 5 ( 1 .5vF)
1.25DvF=2 5 e+2 5vF.
Now subtract the second equation from the ﬁrst, and cancel out vFto deduce
that D=5 0 .
As an aside, note that Equations A.3–A.5 are three equations in four unknowns
(D,e,vM,a n d vF). You will recall that if you have three linear equations
in four unknowns, there can be no unique solution. In our case, however, the
equations are non-linear ,a n dt h e r ei sau n i q u es o l u t i o nf o r D,a ss h o w n .W e
cannot, however, hope to solve for e,vM,o rvF. Nor can we solve for time tM
ortFspent on the escalator by Myron and Fischer, respectively. (We can see,

If, however, any one of e,vM,vF,tM,o rtFis chosen, then we can immediately
solve for all parameters. For example, can you conﬁrm that e= 1 implies that

if you ﬁx tM=1 0 0 ?
Can you conﬁrm that for every proposed numerical example in the previous
paragraph, it was also true that e=vM(i.e., the escalator speed is the same as
the speed of the faster climber)? Must this be true for all numerical examples
in the framework given? Could you have deduced this result before solving for

SECOND SOLUT ION
Keeping all the notation from the ﬁrst solution, note that Myron carries himself
up 25 of the Dsteps, while the escalator carries him the other, say, xsteps.
Thus, 25 + x=D. We will solve for x,a n dt h e nf o r D.
Fischer walks more slowly than Myron. When Fischer has carried himself up
only 20 steps, the escalator will have carried him up k·xsteps, for some k>1.
Thus, 20 + ( k·x)=D. That is, the escalator does more work on Fischer’s
behalf than it does on Myron’s behalf, by a factor of k.
Now, because Myron and Fischer entered side-by-side and the escalator is
moving at a constant speed, this means that when Myron reaches the top, the
escalator has carried both of Myron and Fischer a total of xsteps by that
stage. Fischer, however, has climbed up only2
3as many steps as Myron by
then. That is, Fischer has climbed only 25 ·2

by then. His full trip will take20

3=1.20 times as long as he has taken so far.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 104 All Rights Reserved WorldwideGiven the constant speed of the escalator, this means that the escalator will
end up carrying him an additional 20% of the xit has already carried him.
That is, k=1.2. Putting these together yields Equations A.6–A.8.
25 + x=D (A.6)
20 + ( k·x)= D (A.7)
k=1 .2 (A.8)
Plugging the third equation into the second, and subtracting the result from
the ﬁrst equation, yields 5 −0.2x=0 . S o , x=2 5 ,a n d D= 50, as before.

Alternatively, using the notation from the ﬁrst two solutions, note that Fischer
spent more time on the escalator than Myron. Myron travelled 25 steps at
speed vM, and Fischer travelled 20 steps at speed vF.S o , t h e r a t i o o f t i m e

been carried by it for 1 .2xsteps in time 1 .2tM. This yields Equations A.6–A.8,
as before, thus yielding the solution D=5 0 .
Answer 1.3: If you answered 20 (i.e., 4 ×5) minutes, then go back to the ques-
tion and think again. You need to be hardwired to ignore such “pickpocket
answers” (see story on p. 286).
Although not stated, we should assume the bells ring at equal spaced intervals.
If one bell rings ﬁve times per minute, then that is every 12 seconds. The other,
at four times per minute, rings every 15 seconds. They will next ring together
at the 60 second mark. The answer is one minute.

is not exact because although the array contains two triangular-shaped oﬀ-

Finally, note that four more solutions appear in the answers to Question 1.53,

Answer 1.5: The numbers on the dial add to 78 in total (recall that/summ⎬tiontext12
i=1=

2=6×13). So, each piece must have a total of 26 on it. My initial
attempt was to ﬁnd slices (like pizza slices) that satisfy the constraint. Walking
around the dial looking for consecutive numbers that add to 26, you soon ﬁnd
that 5-6-7-8 adds to 26, and 11-12-1-2 adds to 26, but nothing else works. So,
none of the pieces is pizza-slice shaped. They are 5-6-7-8, 11-12-1-2, and a
band across the middle with 10-9-3-4.
Answer 1.6: This challenging question has been very popular. Sometimes it is
balls, sometimes marbles, sometimes coins. I present two solutions.3
FIRST SOLUT ION4
Let me write, say, 1Hif marble 1 is heavy or potentially heavy (it should be
clear by the context), but if it cannot be light. Similarly, let me write 1Lif
marble 1 is light or potentially light, but if it cannot be heavy. Using this
notation, the 12 marbles yield 24 diﬀerent possible outcomes, because each
marble may be heavy or light, relative to its peers:
1H 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H 10H 11H 12H
1L 2L 3L 4L 5L 6L 7L 8L 9L 10L 11L 12L.
Split the 12 marbles into three groups: Let these be, say, marbles 1–4, marbles
5–8, and marbles 9–12. Compare marbles {1234 }(in the ﬁrst dish) with
marbles {5678 }(in the second dish). There are three cases, as follows.
Case 1: The ﬁrst dish is heavy. In this case, we have reduced the 24 possible
outcomes to only eight possible outcomes, as indicated:
1H 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H 10H 11H 12H
1L 2L 3L 4L 5L 6L 7L 8L 9L 10L 11L 12L.
3One of my readers, who tried this at home, said that the methods given here, while successful
in theory, would not work in practice. He said he would need to add the use of a marker pen to
the problem statement to keep track of which marble was which when swapping marbles between
the dishes on the balance.

The next step is to compare carefully chosen triplets.5Each triplet contains
one possibly heavy marble and two possibly light marbles. Without loss of
generality, let us compare
{1H 5L 6L }with {2H 7L 8L },
while holding out {3H 4H }.6There are three subcases, as follows.
•Subcase 1: The ﬁrst dish is heavy. It must be that one of {1H 7L 8L }is
true. So, just compare {7L}and{8L}to identify the odd marble from
this triplet, and whether it is heavy or light.
•Subcase 2: The ﬁrst dish is light. It must be that one of {5L 6L 2H }is
true. So, just compare {5L}and{6L}to identify the odd marble from
this triplet, and whether it is heavy or light.
•Subcase 3: The dishes are of equal weight. The odd marble was left out of
the second weighing! So, one of {3H 4H }must be true. Now just compare
{3H}and{4H}to identify the odd marble, which must be heavy.
Case 2: The second dish is heavy. Again, the 24 cases are reduced to only
eight possible outcomes, as indicated:
1H 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H 10H 11H 12H
1L 2L 3L 4L 5L 6L 7L 8L 9L 10L 11L 12L.
This is perfectly analogous to Case 1. You get the same three subcases, but
with “ H”s w a p p e dw i t h“ L”i nt h ea r g u m e n t sa l r e a d yg i v e n .
Case 3: The two dishes are of equal weight. Again, the 24 cases are reduced
to only eight possible outcomes, as indicated:

1L 2L 3L 4L 5L 6L 7L 8L 9L 10L 11L 12L.
In this case, compare the suspect marbles {91 01 1 }with three equal-weight
marbles, say, {123 }, while holding out suspect marble 12. There are three
subcases, as follows.
•Subcase 1: The ﬁrst dish is heavy. It must be that one of {9H 10H 11H }is
true. So, just compare {9H}with {10H}to identify the odd marble from
this triplet, which must be heavy.
•Subcase 2: The ﬁrst dish is light. It must be that one of {9L 10L 11L }is
true. So, just compare {9L}with {10L}to identify the odd marble from
this triplet, which must be light.

guilty. Thus, either {12H}or{12L}is true. We can compare {12}with,
say, equal-weight marble {1}to identify whether guilty marble {12}is
heavy or light.
SECOND SOLUT ION7
This solution uses triplets and singletons, and requires slightly diﬀerent nota-
tion. Like the ﬁrst solution technique, the ﬁrst step is to split the 12 marbles
into three groups of four. Each group of four has two subgroups, a singleton
and a triplet: {{1}A,{3}A},{{1}B,{3}B},a n d {{1}C,{3}C}.
Compare {{1}A,{3}A}with {{1}B,{3}B}.I ft h e yb a l a n c e ,t h e nt h eo d db a l l
is in group C. In this case, compare {3}Cwith {3}B.I f {3}Cis heavier
(or lighter), then comparing any two marbles from within {3}Cimmediately
locates the odd one; if {3}Cbalances {3}B,t h e nc o m p a r e {1}Cwith {1}Bto
see whether {1}Cis heavier or lighter.
If the initial comparison is unbalanced, say {{1}A,{3}A}is heavier than
{{1}B,{3}B},t h e nr o t a t eg r o u p s {3}A,{3}B,a n d {3}Cand compare group-
ing{{1}A,{3}B}with {{1}B,{3}C}(while holding out {{1}C,{3}A}). If they
balance, then a heavy marble is in {3}Aand comparing any two marbles from
within {3}Aimmediately locates the odd one. Suppose they do not balance.
If{{1}A,{3}B}is heavy, then either {1}Ais heavy, or {1}Bis light. Compare
{1}Awith {1}Cto ﬁnish. If {{1}A,{3}B}is light, then {3}Bis light and
comparing any two marbles within {3}Bimmediately locates the light one.
In each case, only three weighings are needed. This technique is generalized
in Answer 1.21 (the “90-coin problem”).
Answer 1.7: I have drawn a right-angle triangle on Figure A.1 using R,t h e
radius of the circle. Once we solve for R,t h es i d el e n g t hi s S=2R.
From Figure A.1 we deduce that R2=(R−10)2+(R−5)2(via Pythagoras’
Theorem).8Collecting terms, we quickly ﬁnd that R2−30R+1 2 5 = 0 .It
follows (using the quadratic formula) that this polynomial has two roots R1
andR2given by
R1,R2=−B±√
B2−4AC
2A=30±√900−500
2=1 5 ±10 = 5 ,25.
Only one of those, R= 25, has a sensible physical interpretation in our case.9
It follows that S=2R=5 0 .
7This solution combines independent contributions of Juan Tenorio, Bingjian Ni, Yi Shen, and
Jinpeng Chang; any errors are mine.
8Recall Pythagoras’ Theorem. Consider a triangle with side lengths X,Y, and Z. If the angle
between the sides of length XandYis 90◦, then it is a right-angle triangle. The side of length Z
(the “hypotenuse”) must be the longest side, and it must be that X2+Y2=Z2.

Figure A.1: The Inscribed Circle Answer
Note: A circle is inscribed within a square. A rectangle of dimen-
sions 5 ×10 just ﬁts in one corner. What is the side length Sof
the square? The radius satisﬁes R=S
2.
Answer 1.8: You (the bug) cannot ﬂy; you have to walk. You must ﬁnd the
shortest path from corner to corner.
In any world, the shortest path between two points is called a “geodesic. ” On
a spherical world (e.g., the Earth’s surface), a geodesic is an arc of a “great
circle. ” A great circle is a circle on the surface of the sphere with diameter
equal to the diameter of the sphere. For example, airplanes typically follow
great circles above the Earth (because it is the shortest path and, therefore,
the most fuel-eﬃcient path).
Like a spherical world, the cubic-room world has a two dimensional surface.
However, the lack of curvature in the cubic-room world means that the shortest
distance between two points must be a straight line rather than an arc of a
great circle (in a world without curvature, geodesics are straight lines).
If the cubic room is opened up and ﬂattened out it can be seen that the shortest
path is a straight line from one corner to the other. In the un-ﬂattened room,
this straight line corresponds to two line segments that meet exactly halfway
up one wall-ﬂoor or wall-wall boundary. Direct computation using Pythagoras’
Theorem10reveals that the total path length is√
5u n i t s .
10In this case, the path is the hypotenuse of a triangle of side lengths 2 and 1 in the ﬂattened-out
room or two hypotenuses of triangles each of side lengths 1 and1
2in the un-ﬂattened room. In
either case, the path is of total length√

©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 110 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAnswer 1.9: People tend to overlook the brilliantly simple situation described.
If you did any mathematics whatsoever, you probably missed the point.
No calculation is needed to see that at each stage an equal number of male
babies and female babies are expected to be born. The proportions of male
and female children are, therefore, expected to remain equal at 50%.
Still stuck? Here are the details (standing at t=0a n dl o o k i n ga te x p e c t e d
outcomes only): by the end of the ﬁrst year, the 100,000 families have 50,000
boys and 50,000 girls. The proportion of male children stands at 50%. By the
end of the second year, half of the 100,000 families (the ones without a son)
have another child. This adds 25,000 boys and 25,000 girls. There are now
75,000 boys and 75,000 girls. The proportion of male children still stands at
50%. There are still 25,000 families without a son. They add another 12,500
boys and an equal number of girls, and so on.
Some people are tempted to suppose that because all large families have many
daughters and a single son, there must be more girls than boys. However,
there are not many large families.11
Answer 1.10: The 10 ×10 macro-cube question has been very popular. The most
common mistake is for people to count the number of 1 ×1 micro-cubes on
each face and add them up. Even if you do the mathematics correctly (and
most people do not), you miss the whole point.
If you focus on the 1 ×1m i c r o - c u b e so nt h ef a c e sa n dh o wt oc o u n tt h e m
directly (e.g., How many faces? How many on each face? How many edges?),
then you have been bumped by the pickpocket’s accomplice (see story on
p. 286). Go back now and ﬁgure out a better way. As I stated before, the
path of greatest resistance bears the highest rewards, so read no further unless
you did it a better way.
You must look for structure in a problem that leads you to a simple and speedy
solution. The most structure here is to be found in the macro-cube you start
with and the (now slightly smaller) macro-cube that remains. The diﬀerence
between their volumes is how many micro-cubes fell.
The volume of a cube of side length nisncubed; that is, n3.T h ea n s w e ri s ,
therefore, 103−83.
How do you calculate this without a calculator? You should know that 10k
is a 1 with kzeroes attached, so 103=1,000. You should know that 8 = 23

Answer 1.11: If not for the ability to stop and dump apples along the way,
you could not deliver any apples at all.12So, the key is to make repeated
trips where you dump apples in a pile at the side of the road and then you
subsequently pick up and deliver apples from that apple dump. For example,
suppose you made three trips where each time you left City A with 1,000
apples and dumped 500 uneaten apples at the 500-mile marker. You would
then have accumulated 1,500 apples at the 500-mile marker and you could
deliver 500 of those to City B (e.g., in one trip of 1,000 apples where 500 are
delivered uneaten, and 500 are left to rot at 500-mile marker).
To ﬁnd the optimal strategy, we must put some bounds on what is sensible.
If you are driving away from City A, or away from an apple dump at the side
of the road, then if there are 1,000 or more apples available, it would never
make sense to leave with fewer than 1,000 apples on the truck. For example,
suppose your very ﬁrst move was to drive away from City A with only 900
apples. Well, no matter where you dump the uneaten balance, you missed
out on giving an extra 100 apples a free ride to that spot, and that must be
suboptimal. So, we should drive away from City A only three times, with
1,000 apples on board each time.
The next question is whether, for any one of these three departures from
City A, we dump the uneaten apples at only one apple dump, or whether we
dump them at more than one location. Suppose on one trip we dump 100
apples at the 100-mile marker, and then the uneaten balance at some later
spot. That cannot be sensible, because again, no matter where you dump the
uneaten balance, you missed out on giving an extra 100 apples a free ride to
that spot. So, we must choose a single dump location for each run.
Could dump locations diﬀer by run? Well, as long as we can get the dump
contents to cumulate to a multiple of 1,000 (see below), they should all be
dumped in the same place. Suppose instead that on the third run we dump
apples beyond the location of the dump from the ﬁrst two runs. Then driving
that odd-lot of apples to a further location unnecessarily burns apples because
it subsequently forces the truck to leave the earlier apple dump with fewer
than 1,000 apples. So, not only must we dump the apples in only one location
on any given trip, but we must dump them at the same location on each trip.
So, where do we dump the apples on the three departures from City A, before
subsequently loading up from that combined dump and carrying them further
on? Well, if we dump them at the k-mile marker, we will end up with a total
12Dumping apples part-way into the journey is akin to the “depoting” of food and supplies that
took place during Antarctic journeys (Scott, 2008).

tell us that it makes no sense to drive away from the dump site with fewer
than 1,000 apples on board (unless we have fewer than 1,000 apples available).
So, we will carry the ﬁrst 3,000 apples (spread over three trips) until we can
dump them in a pile of 2,000 apples.
In general, starting with N×1,000 apples, we will carry them (spread over
Ntrips) until we can dump ( N−1)×1,000 apples. If we dump the apples at
thek-mile marker, it must be that N×(1,000−k)=( N−1)×1,000.Solving

2= 500 miles. Then we will have 1,000
apples at the 833-mile marker. We can then drive them on the remaining 167
miles in one trip, delivering 833 apples.13
Extra notes: First, if we dump the apples at the 334-mile marker instead of the
333-mile marker, the ﬁnal answer is unchanged. Second, we can think about
the problem in terms of rate of apple consumption. When we leave City A, we
are burning three apples per mile (one apple per mile per run). We would like
to be running at this costly rate for the shortest distance possible. As soon as
we get to the 333-mile marker, we can reduce this to two apples per mile (by
dumping and then making two runs burning only one apple per mile per run).
As soon as we have driven those 2,000 apples another 500 miles, we can cut the
burn rate down to one apple per mile. You could argue that dumping 2,400
apples at the 200-mile marker would also let you cut the burn rate from three
to two apples per mile. You would, however, leave 400 apples behind to rot.
So, it is better to burn 399 of those 400 apples (over three runs) while carrying
the other 2,001 apples an extra 133 miles closer to City B. Finally, this problem
is isomorphic to one where we have N×1,000 apples and Ntrucks. After

Answer 1.13: I present three diﬀerent solutions: ﬁrst, an approximation that
draws upon the answer to the previous question; second, an exact algebraic
solution; and, third, an exact and slightly more elegant algebraic solution.
FIRST SOLUT ION
An approximate answer is a great place to start.16There are 360◦around the
clock face. The minute hand therefore travels at 6◦per minute. At 3:15 the
minute hand is 7 .5◦behind the hour hand (from the previous answer). To
travel that distance takes 7 .5/6 = 1 .25 minutes. That is, one minute and 15
seconds, or 75 seconds. So, at 3:16:15 the minute hand will arrive where the
hour hand was 75 seconds ago. Of course, the hour hand will have moved ever
so slightly during that 75 seconds. So, maybe you need to wait another, say,
ﬁve seconds until the two hands are perfectly coincident. That would be at
3:16:20. The exact solutions following are less than two seconds away from
this approximate answer.
SECOND SOLUT ION
The question asks the ﬁrst time after 3 pmwhen the hour and minute hands
of a clock are coincident. More generally, we can ask the ﬁrst time after npm
when the hour and minute hands are coincident, for n=1,2,. . . ,11 (we miss
out the 12 because the hands are not coincident after 12 and before 1).
Assume we start at npm,f o ro n eo f n=1,2,. . . ,11. By the time the minute
hand whips around to the non the dial, the hour hand will have moved slowly
on already. When the minute hand ﬁnally catches up with the hour hand, the
hour hand will have moved by a total of θ(n) degrees past the non the dial,
say. The minute hand whips around the dial 12 times faster than the hour
hand. So, while the hour hand covers θ(n) degrees, the minute hand covers
12·θ(n)d e g r e e s .
We can also state that the minute hand must have covered 30 n+θ(n)d e g r e e s .
That is 30 ndegrees to get around to the non the dial, and another θ(n)d e g r e e s
to ﬁnally catch the hour hand. So, we may write 30 n+θ(n)=1 2 ·θ(n), and
thus, θ(n)=3 0 n/11 degrees.17
15There are 2 πradians in a full circle. Thus, 360◦=2πradians; 180◦=πradians; 90◦=π
2
radians; and so on. It is just another way of measuring angles.
16I thank Eoin Healy for suggesting this approximation; any errors are mine.
17It also follows that θ(n)=n·θ(1) for n=1,2,. . . ,11, where θ(1) = 30/11 degrees.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 114 All Rights Reserved WorldwideSo, the ﬁrst time after 3 pmthat the hands are coincident is when the minute
hand has traveled 15 minutes to get to the 3 on the dial and then another
θ(3) = 90/11 degrees past the 3 on the dial. One minute is six degrees. So,
90/11 degrees is90/11
6=90/11
66/11=90
66=124
66=14
11minutes. So, the hands are
coincident at 16 and4
11th’s of a minute after 3 pm.
T HIRD SOLUT ION
At high noon, the hands are coincident. At midnight, the hands are coinci-
dent. The time between noon and midnight is cut into 11 equally-spaced time
intervals of one-eleventh of 12 hours (1:05:27.27). At the end of each of these
intervals, the hands are coincident. For the question at hand, the answer is
three times one-eleventh of 12 hours: 3:16:21.82. The full set of “coincident

Answer 1.14: Well now, this looks pretty complicated the ﬁrst time you see it.
However, there is a simple way to ﬁgure it out. If you think about it, you see
that the only brokers who touch the switch for light bulb number 64 are those
whose numbers are divisors of 64.
That is, light bulb number 64 has its state of illumination changed by brokers
whose numbers are factors of 64. That is, brokers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64
ﬂip the switch. Because light bulb 64 is originally oﬀ,i tm u s tb et h a ta f t e r
this odd number of switches it is on. See Answer 1.15 for a closely related but
more general solution technique.
Answer 1.15: If you now know the answer to Question 1.14, you should be able
to ﬁgure this one out swiftly. If you have not yet ﬁgured out Question 1.14,
then read no further—solve that one ﬁrst.
The only way for a light bulb to be illuminated after the 100th person has
passed through is if its switch was ﬂipped an odd number of times. The
switch for light bulb number Kgets ﬂipped only by people whose numbers
are factors of K.T h u s ,t h eo n l yl i g h tb u l b si l l u m i n a t e da tt h ec o n c l u s i o na r e
those with a number that has an odd number of factors.
However, factors for numbers go in pairs. For example, 32 has factors (1 ,32),
(2,16), and (4 ,8). This means that 32 has an even number of factors, and bulb
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 115 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAPPENDIX A. PURELY QUANTITATIVE & LOGIC ANSWERS
32 is not illuminated at the conclusion. In fact, at ﬁrst glance, all numbers
have an even number of factors.
However, you do get an odd number of factors if two factors (one pair) are
identical. For example, 64 has (8 ,8) as one pair. If one pair of factors are
identical, then the original number must be a “perfect square. ” Therefore, the
only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect squares.
There are exactly 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100, and they are 1, 4, 9,
16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100 (i.e., 12,22,32,...102). These are the numbers
of the 10 bulbs that are illuminated after the 100th person has passed through
the room.
Answer 1.16: This is an old favorite. I have tried this out on people and have
received almost all imaginable responses. The answer is three, and it cannot
be anything else. Two socks can be diﬀerent, but a third must match one of
the ﬁrst two—giving a matching pair.
Answer 1.17: With socks of Ndiﬀerent colors, you must pull ( N+1 ) s o c k s
from the drawer to be sure that you have a matching pair. The argument is
the same as it was for the previous question; Nsocks can be diﬀerent (the
worst-case scenario), but the ( N+1 )stsock must match one of the ﬁrst N
socks—giving a matching pair.
Answer 1.18: Like the answer to the previous question, ask yourself ﬁrst what is
the worst-case scenario? That is, what is the maximum number of socks you
can select without obtaining the required three matching pairs? Recall that
the counts/colors are 2 red, 4 yellow, 6 purple, 8 brown, 10 white, 12 green,
14 black, 16 blue, 18 gray, and 20 orange socks. You will never be able to get
three-pair of the red or yellow socks because there are too few of them. There
are only eight candidate colors remaining. Thus, the worst-case scenario is
that you select 2 red, 4 yellow, and 5 of each of the remaining eight colors,
giving a total of 46 socks. As soon as you select a 47thsock, however, its color
must match the color of one of the previously selected quintuples in those eight
colors. Thus, you need at least 47 socks to guarantee a matching pair.
Answer 1.19: You get the answer by working backwards. If I am your opponent,
and I am able to call out “39,” then you cannot reach 50, but I can after you
say whatever you say. So, my goal is to call out “39. ” However, if I am able
to call out “28,” then you cannot get to 39, but I can after you say whatever
you say. So, my goal is to call out “28. ” To get to 28, I need only to be able
to call out “17,” and to do this, I need only to be able to call out “6.”
So, my strategy, as your opponent, is to get onto the series 6, 17, 28, 39, 50 at
whichever point I can. If you get to go ﬁrst, you should call out “6.” As long
as you know the winning numbers and stick to them, you cannot lose. If you
start with anything other than 6, I cannot lose.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 116 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAnswer 1.20: Safe-cracking in a ﬁnance interview? Yes indeed. The naive an-
swer is that there are 40 possible numbers for the ﬁrst combination, 40 for the
second, and 40 for the third. It would then take at most 403possible trials
to get the safe open. That is 64,000 trials. There are two factors that reduce
this number considerably. The ﬁrst you should have ﬁgured out; the second
you are excused.
The ﬁrst factor is that although three numbers are required to open the safe,
you need only ﬁnd the ﬁrst two of them. If you dial the ﬁrst two numbers
correctly, then you need only turn the dial until the safe pops open. You do
not need to know the last number. This gives 402possible combinations. That
is only 1,600 trials. For extra safe-cracking advice along these lines see Gleick
(1993, pp. 189–190).18
The interviewer in this case suggested a second factor, as follows (and I think it
is a little unfair to any interviewee who is inexperienced in safe-cracking). The
safe is a mechanical device designed with a particular tolerance for inaccuracy.
If the ﬁrst combination number is 14, then dialing either 13, 14, or 15 suﬃces.
This tolerance for inaccuracy brings you down to roughly/p⎬renleft⎜ig
40
3/p⎬renright⎜ig2trials. This
is fewer than 200 trials.
One reader suggested that because you need only ﬁnd a sequence of numbers,
diﬀerent attempts could overlap with other attempts, to reduce the number of
trials needed. If you need to start again at zero every time, however, then this
approach fails. In practice, with real safes, you need to dial clockwise three
times past zero to 75, counter-clockwise two times past zero to 50, clockwise
once past zero to 25, or something like that. So, you need to start anew each
time.
Answer 1.21: To minimize the maximum possible cost of weighing, your strategy
must use the scales as few times as possible, wherever the location of the “bad”
coin. From Answer 1.6, you know that you need three weighings to ﬁnd a bad
coin in a group of 12. You have 90 coins, so it must take at least four weighings.
However, by the same argument, if you had 144 coins (12 groups of 12), you
could identify a bad group of 12 in three weighings and then the bad coin in
another three. So, (because 90 is less than 144) it should take no more than
six weighings—either four, ﬁve, or six weighings.
In fact, it takes only ﬁve weighings (and at most $500) to both ﬁnd the bad
coin and identify it as heavy or light. I present two quite diﬀerent solution
techniques plus a third quasi-solution: the ﬁrst is an ingenious “hammer-
and-tongs” technique, the second is slightly more structured, and the third
generalizes the second but applies only in special cases. In each case, it takes
only ﬁve weighings to both ﬁnd the bad coin and identify it as heavy or light.
18I went to a presentation at MIT at which Jim Gleick (pronounced “Glick”) talked about his then
soon-to-be-published book “Genius. ” He talked about genius in general and Richard P. Feynman
in particular. Feynman was an interesting guy, and this is a good book about him.

FIRST SOLUT ION19
The technique here is similar to the solution techniques in Question 1.6—be
sure to answer that question before answering this one. The ﬁrst move is to
divide the 90 coins into three groups of 30. Weigh two of the groups of 30
coins. Either the scales balance, or they do not. If the scales balance, then
you are left with one group of 30 containing the bad coin. You may “hold out”
10 of these 30 and compare the remaining 20—with 10 on each side. If the
scales balance, you get one group of 10 containing the bad coin. If they do not
balance, you have one group of 10 coins potentially heavy and one group of
10 coins potentially light. Stop here if you just wanted to know how to start
the solution process. This should be enough for you to ﬁnish.
Return for a moment to the case in which the two groups of 30 do not balance.
Set aside 10 potentially heavy coins and 10 potentially light coins. Take the
remaining 20 potentially heavy and 20 potentially light coins and swap 10 of
them from one side of the scales with 10 of them from the other side of the
scales, keeping track of which were swapped and which stayed put. Whether
they balance or not, you can immediately identify one group of 10 coins that
is potentially heavy and one group of 10 coins that is potentially light—the
other 40 are “good” coins.
Thus, after two weighings, the problem reduces either to one group of 10 coins
containing the bad coin (no further information) or two groups of 10 coins
(where one group potentially contains a heavy coin, and the other potentially
contains a light one). I need only demonstrate the solution technique for each
case.
Suppose you have 10 coins, and one of them is bad. You can ﬁnd the bad one
in three weighings simply by adding two good coins and following Answer 1.6
for the 12-ball case. This ﬁnds you the bad coin in a total of ﬁve weighings.
Suppose instead that you have the two groups of 10 coins (where one group
potentially contains a heavy coin, and the other potentially contains a light
one). Use the notation “3 ↑” to denote three potentially light coins, “3 ↓”t o
denote three potentially heavy coins, and “good” to denote one coin known to
be neither heavy nor light. In this case, you begin at the end of the second
weighing with {10↑}and{10↓}on the scales. Hold out 3 ↑and 3 ↓coins and
place the following on the scales for weighing number three: {3↑,4↓}versus
{3↓,4↑}.
Suppose the scales balance with {3↑,4↓}versus {3↓,4↑}.T h e n y o u h a v e 3 ↑
and 3 ↓coins left. Hold out 1 ↑and 1 ↓and weigh {1↑,1↓}versus {1↓,1↑}.I f
these balance, weigh the hold out 1 ↑against one good coin to ﬁnd the bad
one; if they do not balance, you get 1 ↑and 1 ↓from the light and heavy sides,
respectively; and you need only compare one of them with a good coin to ﬁnd
the bad one. This gives a total of ﬁve weighings in either case.

ing of two groups of four in the 12-ball problem in Question 1.6, and you
know the bad coin can be identiﬁed in only two more weighings by rotating
“triplets.” In each case, the bad coin is both located and identiﬁed as heavy
or light in only ﬁve weighings.
SECOND SOLUT ION20
Begin by noting that if you have a group of 3kcoins that is known to contain
ah e a v yc o i n ,i tt a k e so n l y kweighings to identify it. You can see this as
follows: split the group of 3kcoins into three subgroups each of size 3k−1;
now compare any two subgroups on the scales. Whether the scales balance or
not, you know immediately which of the three subgroups contains the heavy
coin. It thus takes only one weighing to go from a group of 3kcoins known to
contain a heavy coin to a group of 3k−1coins known to contain a heavy coin.
Proceeding in this fashion, it takes kweighings to go from a group of 3kcoins
known to contain a heavy coin to a single coin known to be heavy. The same
result applies if the initial sample is known to contain a light coin.
Therefore, if you know that the bad coin in your sample is heavy (or if you
know that it is light), Table A.1 gives the correspondence between sample size
and number of weighings required to locate the bad coin. I now use Table A.1

suﬃcient to identify which subgroup of 27 the bad coin falls into and whether
it is heavy or light. Consulting Table A.1, you can see that in this case it takes
only three additional weighings to ﬁnd the bad coin.
If both the initial weighings balance (i.e., {27}Aversus {27}Band{27}Aversus
{27}Cboth balance), then the bad coin is in the group of nine. Compare
the group of nine to nine good coins taken from the group of 81. This tells
you whether the bad coin is heavy or light. Consulting Table A.1, you can
see that in this case, it takes only two more weighings to ﬁnd the bad coin.
Alternatively, you could have split the group of nine into three groups of three
and weighed two pairs of them. This identiﬁes the group of three containing
the bad coin and tells you whether it is heavy or light. Consulting Table A.1,
you can see that in this case, it takes only one more weighing to ﬁnd the bad
coin. In each case, the bad coin is both located and identiﬁed as heavy or light
in only ﬁve weighings (at a maximum cost of $500).

©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 120 All Rights Reserved WorldwideIt is no coincidence that the ﬁrst column in Table A.2 is the partial sums of
the ﬁrst column in Table A.1—this technique generalizes the second. I prove
the particular case N= 120 (i.e., n= 5), but the proof generalizes directly to
anyN(n)=3n−3
2.
Put the 120 balls into three groups of 40. Each group of 40 is a cohort of
subgroups of size 3kfork=0t o k=n−2:{{1}A,{3}A,{9}A,{27}A};
{{1}B,{3}B,{9}B,{27}B};a n d {{1}C,{3}C,{9}C,{27}C}.
Compare cohorts A and B. If they balance, then you have 80 good balls, and
cohort C contains the bad ball. In this case, compare {27}Cto the good
balls {27}A.I f {27}Ccontains the bad ball, then Table A.1 says you need
three more weighings. If {27}Cis good, then compare {9}Cto the good balls
{9}A.I f{9}Ccontains the bad ball, then Table A.1 says you need two more
weighings. If {9}Cis good, then compare {3}Cto the good balls {3}A. You
need only one more weighing—either because {3}Cis bad (see Table A.1), or
because {3}Cis good (thus {1}Cis bad).
If the initial comparison of A and B does not balance, then rotate (like
changing car tires) groups {27}A,{27}B,a n d {27}Cand compare group-
ing{{1}A,{3}A,{9}A,{27}B}to{{1}B,{3}B,{9}B,{27}C}while holding out
{{1}C,{3}C,{9}C,{27}A}.
There are three possible cases. First, if they balance, then {27}Acontains
the bad ball, and it is known to be heavy or light, and Table A.1 says three
more weighings are needed. Second, if the scales tilt the same way as the
initial comparison of A and B, then you can discard the {27}’s, rotate the
{9}’s, and compare {{1}A,{3}A,{9}B}to{{1}B,{3}B,{9}C}while holding
out{{1}C,{3}C,{9}A}.Y o u e i t h e r ﬁ n d t h a t {9}Ais bad, known heavy or
light, and apply Table A.1, or {9}Bis bad, known heavy or light, and apply
Table A.1, or you discard the {9}’s and rotate the {3}’s. Continue reducing
the problem until convergence—in at most ﬁve weighings. Third, if the scales
tilt the opposite way to the initial comparison of A and B, then {27B}contains
the bad ball, and it is known to be heavy or light, and Table A.1 says three
more weighings are needed.
One problem with this method is what to do if given only 90 balls (more than
39 but fewer than 120). I guess you ask for 30 extra ones and then follow the
procedure for 120.

Begin by proving a lemma (a “helping theorem” to be used in a later proof).
The lemma is used in the proof of a theorem that answers the interview ques-
tion. If you have a mathematical background but cannot answer the question,
you should read the statement of the lemma, and stop reading there. You
should then try to complete the remainder of the proof on your own. This is
more satisfying than seeing the full proof.

Answer 1.23: After 100 seconds you can be sure that the ants have all walked
oﬀ the ruler. The answer is the same as if the ants had perfect vision. The
key is that if two ants who collide, immediately about face and continue, then
each member of any colliding pair eﬀectively exchanges its exit route with the
other; the ants are fungible. It is just as if one of the colliding pair crawled
over the other and they both kept going without pause.

Answer 1.24: If you can ﬁgure out the correct relationship between the eight
lily pads and the single one, you get the answer. If you do not have it yet, or
you think it is 3.75 days, then you should stop reading now, and go back and
try again. I am serious; this is a nice question, and you lose a great deal by
peeking at the answers to help you out.
The naive answer is that it takes30
8=3.75 days. This is, of course, incorrect.
The lily pads in the question all grow at the same rate. This means that you
may think of the eight lily pads as being equivalent to one big lily pad. Indeed,
when the single lily pad is three days old, it has the same area as the eight
lily pads do at time zero. This means that you may think of the eight lily
pads as a single lily pad that is three days old. It takes another 27 days for a
three-day-old single lily pad to cover the pond, so it also takes 27 days for the
eight lily pads to cover the pond.
The interviewee suggested that I use 3,000 days instead of 30 days as the time
it takes for the single lily pad to cover the pond. The idea was to make the
question more confusing. The problem with this is that, no matter how small
the initial lily pad (assuming it is visible to the naked eye), it will cover the
surface of the Earth within 100 days and the entire solar system not long
after. Within 3,000 days, the universe will be blotted out—such is the power
of compound growth.
Answer 1.25: You use the same idea as in the previous lily pad question. Each
pad needs to cover6,000
27square feet to choke the pond. The size of each
pad is 2Nafter Ndays, so you need to solve:6,000
27=2N.T h e s o l u t i o n i s
N=log(2,000
9)
log(2)≈7.8d a y s .28
Without a calculator, you can still do it in your head. You calculate6,000
27as
approximately 200. You know that 28is 256, which exceeds 200; whereas 27
is 128, which falls short, so eight days should do the trick.
Answer 1.26: Decimal pricing was introduced on the New York Stock Exchange
in 2001. I have left this question in because there are many people who lived
with eighths and sixteenths for most of their working life, and they may be
tempted to ask you about it. I am still seeing this question being asked every
year.
Most people stumble a little. Do not memorize all the possible sixteenths
before your interview—you have worse things to worry about (much worse).
Add or subtract one-sixteenth to get the requested fraction into quarters or
eighths and then compensate for your adjustment.
You should remember that1
8is 0.1250 and deduce from that that1
16is 0.0625
(you should be able to give anyeighth in decimal form). The fraction13
16is only
one-sixteenth away from12
16which is exactly three quarters (0 .7500). You need
28An interesting aside here is that it does not matter which logarithm function you use. The
result is the same regardless of the base.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 124 All Rights Reserved Worldwideonly add 0 .0625 to 0 .7500 to get 0 .8125. Similarly,9
16is only one-sixteenth
over one-half, and is, therefore, 0 .5625.
Answer 1.27: This is a common question. The naive answer is that the snail
climbs a net of two feet per day, so it reaches the 10-foot mark at the end of
the ﬁfth day. However, on the morning of the ﬁfth day, the snail starts out
at the eight-foot mark (having slid down from the nine-foot mark overnight).
Two-thirds of the way through the ﬁfth day, the snail reaches the 10-foot mark
and stops because there is no pole left to climb.
Story: One interviewee was asked, “If you are holding a dinner party, and
you can invite any three dead people (presumably resurrected), who would
you choose? Please do not choose any relatives.” Give it some thought.
Answer 1.28: Here are two answers.29
1. Turn Switch #1 on. Wait a while. Then turn it oﬀ while simultaneously
turning Switch #2 on. Go into the room. The illuminated light corre-
sponds to Switch #2. The warm non-illuminated bulb corresponds to
Switch #1. The cold non-illuminated bulb corresponds to Switch #3.
2. Guess. You have a one-in-six chance if they are random. However, light
switches are not usually random. If you assume the switches are phys-
ically located in an order that relates to the physical placement of the
bulbs (as they usually are), then you have a ﬁfty-ﬁfty chance!
Answer 1.29: The only way the ﬁrst man can know the color of his own hat is if
he sees the other two wearing red hats—of which there are only two. However,
the ﬁrst man does notknow his hat color, so the other two must be wearing
either both blue or one red and one blue. The second man, upon hearing the
ﬁrst, knows then that he and the third man are either both wearing blue hats,
or one wears a red hat, and one a blue. If he still does not know what color
hat he is wearing, it must be because the third man is wearing a blue hat.
Why? Well, if the third man wears red, then that pinpoints his own hat as
blue since this is the only option left from the choice of either both blue or
one red and one blue. Since the second man does not know his hat color, then
the third man must be wearing blue. The third man, upon hearing the ﬁrst
two, deduces that his own hat is blue via the same reasoning.
Answer 1.30: You may be looking to the solutions for a hint. My ﬁrst hint is
that, if you are using linear algebra (i.e., solving systems of equations by sub-
stitution) then stop that right now. There are nine equations in 10 unknowns,
so this will get you nowhere. In fact, there are inﬁnitely many integers that
solve the problem statement; we are searching for the smallest such number.
My second hint is that you might like to try drawing a picture.

FIRST SOLUT ION
My ﬁrst solution technique begins with the simultaneous equation approach
and quickly abandons it. Let Xdenote the solution. Then I know there exist
positive integers X2,X3,X4,. . . ,X10,s u c ht h a t
X=2 ×X2+1,
X=3 ×X3+2,
X=4 ×X4+3,
X=5 ×X5+4,
...
X=1 0 ×X10+9.
Looking at the equations, it is clear that the coeﬃcients on the right-hand side
diﬀer from the remainders by only one. If we simply add one to both sides of
each equation, then the coeﬃcients and the remainders will be identical, and
we can collect terms to obtain the following:
X+1 = 2 ×X′
2,
X+1 = 3 ×X′
3,
X+1 = 4 ×X′
4,
X+1 = 5 ×X′
5,
...
X+1 = 1 0 ×X′
10
Where X′
n≡Xn+1 for each nbetween 2 and 10. With this simple restatement,
the problem now requires that we ﬁnd the smallest number X,s u c ht h a t X+1
is perfectly divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. That is, ﬁnd a number
X,s u c ht h a t X+1= lcm(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), where lcm(·)i st h e
lowest common multiple operator. Given various redundancies, we conclude
that X=lcm(6,7,8,9,10)−1=2 5 2 0 −1=2 5 1 9i st h es o l u t i o n .
Looking at my restatement of the problem, it should be clear that if Xsolves
X+1 = K×lcm(6,7,8,9,10), for any positive integer K,t h e n Xis
also a solution to the problem (but not the smallest unless K=1 ) . T h a ti s ,
X=K×lcm(6,7,8,9,10)−1=K×2520 −1i sa l s oas o l u t i o nf o ra n y
positive integer K.
I think the interviewer would have been perfectly happy to hear that X=
lcm(6,7,8,9,10)−1, without your having to ﬁnd the lcm.H o w e v e r , t h i s
does leave one question unanswered: What is the most eﬃcient way to ﬁnd
the lowest common multiple of a group of numbers?30
30In this case, if you factor each of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, you get 2 ×3, 7, 2 ×4, 3×3, and 2 ×5. The lcm,
when factorized, must include each of these expressions. Indeed, 2 ×3×3×4×5×7=2 ,520—the
lcm.

and using algebra; I discovered it by drawing a picture. It is somewhat diﬃcult
to reproduce my picture, but here is an attempt using a sporting analogy (see
Figure A.2).
I am searching for a number Xwith the divisor/remainder properties de-
scribed. I have nine runners to help me: Mr. 2, Mr. 3, ..., Mr. 9, and Mr. 10.
They are assembled at the start of an arbitrarily long, dead-straight, sand-
covered, nine-lane racetrack that has distances measured in meters, beginning
at “0” at the starting line (bear with me on this). Like many race tracks made
for people, the people do not all start in the same place; their positions are
staggered (which makes no sense for a straight track in the real world). Mr. 2
starts 1 meter from the zero line. Mr. 3 starts 2 meters from the zero line.
Mr. 4 starts 3 meters from the zero line, ... and Mr. 10 starts 9 meters from
the zero line.
The gun ﬁres, and the race begins. Each Mr. nruns taking steps of length n
meters (for nbetween 2 and 10). The runners each leave footprints in the sand
on the track. Let them run for a very long time and then look at the footprints
(we do not care who wins). Starting at the zero line, the divisor/remainder
properties of Ximply that the ﬁrst time you ﬁnd a row of nine footprints
adjacent to each other must be after Xmeters.
The ﬁrst time the footprints (the solid bullets in Figure A.2) are aligned verti-
cally, is when they have reached the solution, Xmeters from the zero starting
line. We can see that the number of meters they step out before beginning is
one less than their step size when they run. If you look one pace backwards
from the start line (back to position −1o nt h er a c et r a c k ) ,t h e ni ts h o u l d
be clear that the distance from the −1p o s i t i o nt o X(i.e., X+1 )i sj u s tt h e
lcmof the step sizes taken by the runners (how else could the footprints be
adjacent?). It should also be clear that if you look beyond X,y o uw i l lﬁ n d
another set of adjacent footprints after you travel another lcmmeters. This
solution is identical to the ﬁrst.
Answer 1.31: This is easier than it sounds. You do not need any inﬁnite sums,
and, if you used them, go back and try again before reading on. For every two
miles covered by the ﬁrst motorcyclist, the second covers three miles. Two plus
three is ﬁve, and there are ﬁve multiples of ﬁve between them. This means
they will meet after the ﬁrst has traveled 10 miles and the second 15. We
know that the ﬂy moves at twice the speed of the ﬁrst motorcyclist, so it must
cover 20 miles before its miserable life ends.
Many other solutions exist. Here is one I liked.31The second motorcyclist is
approaching the ﬁrst at a relative speed of 20 + 30 = 50 miles per hour. With
25 miles between them, they will collide after one-half of an hour. Meanwhile,

Note: In the picture, the nine people run side by side. Mr. 2 steps
out one meter to start (the hollow bullet) and then take steps of
length two meters (his footsteps are solid bullets). Mr. 3 steps out
two meters to start and then take steps of length three, and so
on up until Mr. 10, who steps out nine meters to start and then
takes steps of length 10.
the ﬂy is travelling at 40 miles per hour. So, it must cover only 20 miles in
that time.
Story: “Every morning I see job candidates who spend a day here. I talk to
them, answer questions about our company, tell them whom they’ll interview
with, and send them oﬀ. At the end of the day, when they come back,
I determine whom they’d most like to work for, brief them on employee
beneﬁts, and tell them what happens next. I went through the morning
ritual recently with one young candidate and then told him I’d see him about
4p.m. ‘I don’t want to come back here,’ he said, quite emphatically. ‘I’ve
already talked to a guy I know who has been here before, and he told me
everything you’re going to tell me. ’ ”

any triangle and which are clearly visible in Figure A.3:
1. The area Ais given by A=1

2. Pythagoras’ Theorem implies that a2=h2+d2andc2=h2+(b+d)2.
3. The ﬁrst Pythagorean result implies h2=a2−d2.W h e n t h e s e c o n d
Pythagorean result is subtracted from the ﬁrst, it yields c2−a2=(b+

A popular alternate proof of Heron’s (Hero’s) formula inscribes a cir-
cle in the triangle and then uses trigonometry (Strogatz, 2009, pp. 143–
146). There is a related result (Brahmagupta’s formula) for the area of a
cyclic quadrilateral (i.e., one that may be inscribed in a circle): A(s)=/r⎬dic⎬l⎭ig
(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)(s−d), where s=( a+b+c+d)/2 is the semi-
perimeter, and a,b,c,a n d dare the side lengths (Strogatz, 2009, p. 160).
Note that if we let d→0, we get Heron’s formula, which makes sense.

Answer 1.34: I present two solution techniques: an elegant approach followed
by a “hammer-and-tongs” brute-force approach. I think you should start with
ar o u g hg u e s s ;m i n ei sa b o u tah a l f .
FIRST SOLUT ION37
Simplify the problem by assuming that the “very large number” of people is
almost an inﬁnite number. In this case, it is as though each person is ﬁrst
in line to be allocated a key because the previous ﬁnite number of people
are negligible compared to the almost inﬁnite number of people waiting to
receive keys. It follows that each person has the same probability,1
N, of being
allocated his or her key. Let Xbe the number of people who end up sleeping
in their own rooms, then

where “ * ” is true for Ninﬁnitely large.
SECOND SOLUT ION38
Consider ﬁrst the simple cases in which there are two or three guests. It soon
becomes clear that you need to consider many diﬀerent overlapping events and
that you need to account for intersections of events. That is, you need basic
set theory.
LetAk,f o r k=1,. . . , N ,d e n o t et h ee v e n tt h a tt h e kth guest sleeps in the
room to which he or she was originally assigned (i.e., his or her “own room”).
What we need to ﬁnd is the probability that at least one of the guests ends up
in his or her own room. This event is the union of the individual events and
occurs with probability: P(/uniontextN
k=1Ak).
If you draw the familiar case of three intersecting circles—each representing
an event—it is relatively straightforward to deduce the following inclusion-
exclusion formula:

All you are doing here is adding the original event probabilities, then taking
out the intersections where you double counted, then adjusting for the fact

his or her own room. That is, P(Ai)=1

The ﬁnal result is about 63%, but a guess of2

Answer 1.35: Assume there are Npeople at the party. Assume the ﬁrst person
starts the ball rolling by shaking hands with the N−1 other people. Then
the second person has already shaken hands with the ﬁrst person, and only
needs to shake hands with N−2 people. Similarly, the third person only
needs to shake hands with N−3 people. And so on. Eventually, the ( N−1)th
person shakes hands with the Nthperson, and by this time, the Nthperson has
already shaken hands with everyone. So, the count of handshakes is/summ⎬tiontextN−1
i=1i.
From Answer 1.4, we know this sum is/summ⎬tiontextN−1
i=1i=N(N−1)/2. We could set

this equal to 66, and solve the quadratic, or we could just try a few values
until we converge. The quadratic is N2−N−132 = 0, with roots N=/p⎬renleft⎜ig
1±√
529/p⎬renright⎜ig/sl⎬sh⎜ig
2={−11,12}. Obviously, 12 is the answer.
In fact, I solved the problem slightly diﬀerently. I pictured Npeople standing
in a row across the top of a chessboard-like empty matrix of squares, and the
same Npeople standing down the side of the matrix. I put a mental dot into
each square that corresponds to a handshake between someone on the vertical
and someone on the horizontal. So doing marks out the upper-triangular part
of the matrix, above the diagonal (or below it; you can choose). So, the
total number of handshakes is the same as the number of elements above the
diagonal in an N×Nmatrix. So, I take N2for the total count, subtract the
diagonal count of N,a n dd i v i d eb yt w o . T h a ti s ,( N2−N)/sl⎬sh⎭ig2=N(N−1)/2,
as above. Then I guessed it must be 12 or 13, to get 66 oﬀ-diagonal dots.
Answer 1.36: Before tackling this problem (i.e., the expected number of pairs
of people with a matching birthday in a group of 25), let us solve the more
traditional birthday problem. In a group of Npeople, what is the probability
p(N)t h a tt h e r ea r ea tl e a s tt w op e o p l ew i t ht h es a m eb i r t h d a y ? I ti so f t e n
easier to work out the complement. So, let us ﬁgure the probability that no
people in a group of Npeople share a birthday.
Assume 365 days in a year, and all birthdays equally likely, and all birthdays
independent across partygoers. Let D(N)d e n o t et h ee v e n tt h a ta l l Nper-
sons have d iﬀerent birthdays. How does D(N)h a p p e n ?W e l l ,w i t h o u tl o s so f
generality, suppose the ﬁrst person we pick has birthday January 1. Then, to
have diﬀerent birthdays, there are only 364 choices left for the second person.
Without loss of generality, let us assume the second person’s birthday is Jan-
uary 2. Then, to have diﬀerent birthdays, there are only 363 choices left for
the third person, and so on. The overall space of possible birthday N−tuples
contains 365Nchoices. So, the probability that all Npersons’ birthdays are
diﬀerent is given by Equation A.10, for N=1,...,365.

of the people to raise their hands (to two decimal places). For
N≥5,040, we expect N=E[H(N)] (to two decimal places).

Now let us turn to the problem of the expected number of pairs of people
with the same birthday in a group of size N. Well, how many distinct pairs of
people are there altogether, regardless of birthdays? In a group of size N≥2,
there are n=/p⎬renleft⎭igN
2/p⎬renright⎭ig=N(N−1)
2distinct pairs. For example, in a group of size
N= 4, there are six pairs: {(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,4)}.T h e p a i r s
are not independent. For example, if pair (1 ,2) have the same birthday, and
pair (2 ,3) have the same birthday, then what do we know about pair (1 ,3)?
Surely, they have the same birthday too.
Now pick any pair. What is the likelihood that this particular pair have
matching birthdays? It is just p=1 / 3 6 5( b e c a u s eg i v e nt h eb i r t h d a yo ft h e

With count of pairs of people n=/p⎬renleft⎭igN

given by E(B-Pairs) = np=/p⎬renleft⎭igN

365.Note that this is true even though the
pairs are not independent (because it is just an expectation over the pairs).
For example, some values of E(B-Pairs) appear in Table A.3. In a group of
size 25, we expect only 0.82 birthday pairs (slightly less than one pair). As
the size of the party increases, the number of pairs raises at a quadratic rate.
Answer 1.37: Now let us turn to the expected number of people with a matching
birthday in a group of 25. In the question, we said that we would ask the
partygoers to raise a hand if someone else at the party had the same birthday.
So, let us solve for E[H(N)], where H(N)i st h en u m b e ro fh a n d sr a i s e d ,t o

Let me number the people from 1 to N.L e t m e l o o k a t t h e ﬁ r s t p e r s o n .
The probability that the ﬁrst person does not have the same birthday as the
second person is 364/365. All birthdays are independent of each other. So,

.
For example, some values of E(H) appear in Table A.3. In a group of size 25,
we expect only 1.59 hands to be raised. As the size of the party increases, the
proportion of hands raised climbs slowly to 100%.
Answer 1.38: To maximize the probability that I win the free ticket, I will ask
my twin brother to stand at position number one in line, and then I will stand
right behind him. Failing that, let us assume that birthdays are uniformly
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 136 All Rights Reserved Worldwidedistributed over the year, and that birthdays of people joining the line are
independent of birthdays of other people joining the line, and that there are
365 days in a year (i.e., not a leap year).
Before doing any mathematics, we should give a gut instinct estimate, both to
show the interviewer that we can give an estimate, and to give a benchmark
with which we can compare our computed answer. Obviously you do not
want to be ﬁrst in line, and you do not want to be after position 366 (both
discussed further below). You will recall also, from the traditional birthday
problem discussed in Answer 1.37, that the likelihood of a birthday match
ahead of you rises quickly with group size. So, if you stand at position 10, say,
with 9 people ahead of you, there only a roughly 10% probability that there is
a matching pair ahead of you, and you do not get the prize (see Table A.3). If
you stand at position 24, say, with 23 people ahead of you, there is already a
roughly 50% probability that there is a matching pair ahead of you, and you
do not get the prize. If you stand at position 58, with 57 people ahead of you,
there is a roughly 99% probability that there is a matching pair ahead of you,
and you do not get the prize. You want a high probability that your birthday
matches the birthday of someone ahead of you (which is true the further you
stand from the box oﬃce), but a low probability that a matching pair is ahead
of you (which is true the closer you stand to the box oﬃce). My guess is that
Iw i l ln o tw a n tt os t a n da n yf u r t h e rf r o mt h eb o xo ﬃ c et h a np o s i t i o n2 5 ,a n d
no closer than position 10.
LetW(k)d e n o t et h ee v e n tt h a tt h e kthperson in line w ins the prize. Let
p(k)≡P[W(k)] be the probability of event W(k). Let D(k−1) be the event
that the ﬁrst k−1p e o p l eh a v ed iﬀerent birthdays. Let S(k)b et h ee v e n tt h a t
the birthday of the kthperson in line is the s ame as the birthday of one of the
ﬁrstk−1p e o p l e .
Then, to win the ticket, it needs to be true both that all k−1 people ahead
of me have diﬀerent birthdays (i.e., event D(k−1) happens), and that one
of them has the same birthday as I do (i.e., event S(k)h a p p e n s ) . T h a ti s ,
Equation A.12 holds.
p(k)= P[W(k)]
=P[D(k−1)∩S(k)]
=P[D(k−1)]·P[S(k)|D(k−1)] (A.12)
What about boundary conditions? From the structure of the problem, it must
be that p(1) = 0, because there is nobody ahead of me. If I am second in
line, then P[D(1)] = 1, and P[S(2)|D(1)] = 1/365. So, p(2) = 1/365. At the
other end of the line, if I am at position 367 or higher, then p(k)=0 . ( A b s e n t
leap years, two people among the ﬁrst 366 must have the same birthday, so
the prize can never go to someone after position 366.) So,/uniontext366

Simple intuition tells us that p(k) is at ﬁrst increasing, because for very small

much with kat ﬁrst, whereas P[S(k)|D(k−1)] increases rapidly. For large
k,h o w e v e r , P[S(k)|D(k−1)] drops rapidly, outweighing the linear growth in
P[D(k−1)].
So, to ﬁnd the peak in p(k), we need to ﬁnd where p(k+1 ) −p(k)<0. That
is, where the probability of winning at the next ( k+1 )thplace in line is lower
than it is at the kthplace in line. Given the functional form of p(k), working
with diﬀerences is not going to reduce complexity. So, we should re-express

Sure enough, if you calculate p(k)f o r k=2,...,366, the pmf is a smooth (at
least for a pmf) right-tailed uni-modal distribution with a peak at p(20) ≈

Answer 1.39: First of all, “very small” is classic physics slang for very, very small
(i.e., so small that it is a pinpoint mass). If the rock is tossed overboard, the
water level falls as though water equal in mass to the mass of the rock is being
sucked out of the pool. The rock forces the boat to displace the rock’s mass
of water. After the rock is gone, the boat rises up, and the water level falls
down (Archimedes’ Principle).40
The next time you are washing dishes, try this experiment. With the sink
half-full of water, ﬂoat a drinking glass. Now drop a steel ball bearing gently
into the glass. The glass sinks down, displacing a mass of water equal in mass
to the mass of the ball bearing, and the water level rises. Now pluck the ball
bearing from the glass, using a magnet. The reverse happens, the glass rises,
and the water level falls as though water equal in mass to the mass of the ball
bearing is being sucked out of the sink.
How does your answer change if the rock is replaced by a piece of pumice
(i.e., ﬂoating volcanic glass), or by a 100lb ice cube, or by a tethered helium
balloon (to be set free, tether and all)?
Answer 1.40: The answer involves both mathematical induction and game the-
oretic arguments. If there is exactly one cheating man in the town, Mr. C, say,
then every wife except Mrs. C knows who he is. Not only that, but Mrs. C
is unaware of any cheats—the stranger’s announcement comes as a shock to
her. Immediately after the stranger’s announcement, Mrs. C asks: “Who can
be cheating if I have seen no cheats?” The only possible answer is it is Mr. C.
Come the next morning, his happy days are over, and out he goes.
Suppose instead that there are exactly two cheating men in town: Mr. C1 and
Mr. C2. In this case, Mrs. C1 knows there is one cheat in town (Mr. C2), and
Mrs. C2 knows there is one cheat in town (Mr. C1)—the stranger’s announce-

in town and fully expects him to be kicked out the next morning (each wife
thinks the other poor woman is in the position of Mrs. C mentioned above).
The ﬁrst morning after the announcement comes, and the streets are bare.
Mrs. C1 concludes that Mrs. C2 did not kick her husband out because she did
not think he was a cheat. How could Mrs. C2 be so foolish? Mrs. C1 knows
that Mrs. C2 believes the prophecy, so the only possible reason for Mrs. C2
not to have reacted is if Mrs. C2 saw a cheat herself. Mrs. C1 asks herself:
“Who did Mrs. C2 see cheating, when the only cheat I can see is Mr. C2?”
The only possible answer is that it is her own man, Mr. C1. Come the second
morning after the announcement, Mr. C1 and Mr. C2 are both kicked out (the
latter because Mrs. C2 went through the same thought process).
Suppose now that there are exactly three cheating men in town: Mr. C1,
Mr. C2, and Mr. C3. In this case, each of Mrs. C1, Mrs. C2, and Mrs. C3
thinks that there are two cheats in town and believes in the innocence of her
own man. However, come the second morning, they are each very surprised
to ﬁnd the streets empty. Had there been exactly two cheats, as each of the
wives had surmised, then the cheats should have been kicked into the street two
mornings after the announcement—as per the argument above. The empty
street means that a third cheater exists—one previously assumed innocent! So,
three mornings after the announcement, all three cheating men are bounced
out into the street.
More generally, let me assert that if there are exactly ncheats, then they
will all be kicked out into the street on the nthmorning after the stranger’s
announcement. If my assertion is true for ncheats, and a wife sees nother
cheats but ﬁnds the streets bare on the nthmorning, then she is shocked to
conclude that her own man must be unfaithful to her. She (and each of the
other nwives) will kick her man out the next morning. That is, if there are
n+1c h e a t s ,t h e nt h e yw i l lb ek i c k e do u to nt h e( n+1 )stmorning. That is,
if my assertion is true for ncheats, then it is also true for n+1c h e a t s .
I proved my assertion to be true for nequal to each of one, two, and three. It
follows my mathematical induction that it is true for all n(in fact, I needed
only to prove it for n=1f o rt h ep r o o ft og ot h r o u g h ) .
It follows that if cheating men are kicked into the street for the ﬁrst time
on the tenth morning after the stranger’s announcement, then there must be
exactly 10 of them.

Case n=1 : With one ring, it certainly takes exactly one move. My assertion
is thus true for the case n=1 .

Using the coordinates in Figure A.4, the coastline is the line x=L.T h e

SECOND SOLUT ION
Follow the beam’s course for a small time interval dt. In Figure A.4, we
see that the beam’s spot covers a distance D=Vd talong the coast, while
the beam’s “perpendicular motion” covers a distance D1=ωRdt (where V
is the spot’s speed along the coast, and ω=2π

beam’s angular velocity). For small dt, the distance triangle is a right-angle

Answer 1.50: The sum/summ⎬tiontext∞
n=1e−√ntakes the form/summ⎬tiontext∞
n=1an,w h e r e an≡e−√n.
There is a whole host of tests for the convergence of such sums. Before we
look at these, a short review of the terminology is in order.
A“ s e q u e n c e ”i sas e to fn u m b e r s a1,a2,a3,...indexed in a particular order
corresponding to the natural numbers. We may denote the sequence as “ {an}.”
Each number, an, in the sequence is a “term. ” The “limit of a sequence” exists
and is equal to l<∞if the numbers anget closer and closer to lasngets
larger. That is, lim n→∞an=l. If such a limit exists, then the sequence is
said to “converge” to that limit, and the limit is unique. If a sequence does
not converge, then it “diverges. ” There is no mention of additivity here: A
sequence is a succession, not a sum.
A “series” is formed from a sequence via partial sums. Let S1=a1,S2=
a1+a2,S3=a1+a2+a3,a n ds oo n ,s ot h a t Sn=/summ⎬tiontextn
i=1aiis the nth“partial
sum” of the sequence {an}.T h e n t h e s u m/summ⎬tiontext∞
n=1anis referred to as an “inﬁnite
series. ” The inﬁnite series/summ⎬tiontext∞
n=1anis said to be “convergent” if the sequence
of its partial sums {Sn}is convergent.
A necessary (but not suﬃcient) condition for convergence of an inﬁnite series
{an}is that an→0a s n→∞.I n o u r c a s e , an=e−√n→0, so we cannot
reject convergence.
The ﬁrst (of several) formal tests that comes to mind is The Ratio Test (for
series with positive terms only):

When the two tests above fail, we head for Raabe’s Test (for series with

However, the algebraic proof that that last limit exceeds one is by no means
elegant. Instead of proving it, I present another test of convergence that is
both elegant and conclusive.

The Integral Test applies to a series/summ⎬tiontextanof positive terms. Let A(x)d e n o t e

either both converge, or both diverge (Anton [1988, p. 623]).

n=1an, we may look at
convergence of/integr⎬ltext+∞
x=1A(x), where A(x)≡e−√xis seen to be both decreasing

It is worth noting that if/summ⎬tiontext|an|converges, then/summ⎬tiontextanconverges also. The
former is referred to as “absolute convergence. ” Thus, absolute convergence
of an inﬁnite series is suﬃcient for convergence. Absolute convergence is not,
however, a necessary condition for convergence. A series that is convergent,
but not absolutely convergent, is said to be “conditionally convergent. ”

Answer 1.51: The numbers used and the situation described may diﬀer from
question to question, but the general solution technique is always the same.
Factor the product into all possible triplets: (1,2,18), (1,3,12), (1,4,9), (1,6,6),
(2,2,9), (2,3,6), and (3,3,4). Which one is it? Well, Mary knows the sum,
and these potential triplets sum to 21,16,14,13,13,11, and 10, respectively.
Knowing the sum was not suﬃcient for Mary to pin down the triplet, so it
must be a triplet with a non-unique sum: 13 in this case. This cuts down the
candidates to (1,6,6) and (2,2,9). John says the eldest is dyslexic, so there
must be an eldest (ignoring rubbish answers like one twin is 20 minutes older
than the other). That just leaves (2,2,9).
Answer 1.52: You know one of the eight balls is heavy. Compare one group of
three to another group of three. You need only one more weighing—for a total
of two weighings.
Answer 1.53: The sums in Table A.6 are well known (the ﬁrst is discussed ex-
tensively in the answer to Question 1.4).49You should certainly know the ﬁrst
sum by heart, and you should note that the third is the ﬁrst squared.

Answer 1.54: You win if you can place the last coin on the table and leave no
space for me to place a further coin. A necessary condition is that the table be
radially symmetric. That is, there must exist a central point on the table (at
its center of mass if the table is of uniform density and thickness) such that any
line drawn upon the table passing through this central point is evenly bisected
at this central point. Simple examples are a square, an ellipse, a rectangle, a
circular disc, etc.
You should play ﬁrst and place your ﬁrst quarter at the center of the table.
You should make subsequent moves by imitating me: Place your quarter in the
mirror image of my position when viewed looking through the central point.
This ensures victory because if I can still place a coin on the table, then so
can you.55
Although radial symmetry is necessary, it is not suﬃcient. The strategy does
not necessarily work if the table is a regular shape but not a simply-connected
one; for example, an annulus.56If the table is an annulus and the hole in the
middle is bigger than a quarter, then the only change to your winning strategy
is that you should let me go ﬁrst.
Story: A student of mine was asked “How would you value yourself?” That
is, put a dollar ﬁgure on your value using discounted cash ﬂow analysis.
Answer 1.55: No, you deﬁnitely cannot tile the 62 squares with the dominoes.
If you cannot see why, then go back and think again before reading on.
55I thank Tim Hoel and Victor H. Lin for this elegant solution technique.
56An “annulus” is a disc with a hole in the center—like a musical compact disc, for example.
An annulus is path connected (any two points may be joined by a line), and is therefore connected
(it cannot be split into two non-empty non-intersecting open sets), but it is not simply connected
(which requires path-connectivity and that any loop may be shrunk continuously within the set).

dominoes, you cover the same number of black squares as white ones. However,
the two squares that are oﬀ limits are the same color (opposing corners on a
chessboard must be the same color). Thus, the number of white squares to
be covered is not the same as the number of black, and the dominoes cannot
cover them all.57
Naoki Sato has supplied an answer to his follow-up question. Imagine a closed
path on the chessboard that passes through every square exactly once (moving
horizontally and vertically, eventually returning to the original square). The
two “X”s, unless adjacent, divide this path into two sections. Since one “X”
is on black, and one is on white, the two sections each cover an even number
of squares. They may thus be tiled using the dominoes. If the two “X”s are
adjacent, the solution is obvious.
Answer 1.56: Deciphering the optimal strategy is analogous to locating an opti-
mal stock price exercise boundary for an American-style option. Calculating
the expected payoﬀ to the game, assuming the optimal strategy, is analogous
to valuing an American-style option. Like valuing an American option, you
have to work backward through a decision tree, calculating the expected pay-
oﬀs to proceeding versus stopping at each node. For two, four, six, and eight
cards, the expected payoﬀ to the game is $1
2,$2
3,$17
20, and $1, respectively,
when following the optimal strategy. The two-card game decision tree is a
sub-tree of the four-card game decision tree, so later results can be appended
to earlier ones. Stop reading here and try to replicate these numbers.
LetRandBdenote the number of red and black cards, respectively, when
you begin play ( R=B=2 6i no u rc a s e ) . L e t randbdenote the number
of red and black cards remaining in the deck at some intermediate stage of
the game when you are trying to decide whether to take another card. You

current accumulated score is the number of reds drawn so far less the number
of blacks drawn so far: ( R−r)−(B−b). The expected value of the game
V(r, b) is the current accumulated score plus the additional expected value,
if any, remaining in the deck, assuming optimal play. With randbcards
remaining, denote this additional expected value as E(r, b). Thus, the value
of the game is V(r, b)=( R−r)−(B−b)+E(r, b). Simple logic dictates that
57An alternative solution has been suggested to me by Aidong Chen. Let each square on the
board be described by its coordinates ( x, y) for 1 ≤x, y≤8. Any domino covers two adjacent
squares, either ( x, y) and ( x, y+ 1), or ( x, y) and ( x+1,y). If we add those coordinates up, we
get 2 x+2y+ 1 in either case. To tile the 62 remaining squares requires 31 dominoes. If we add
up 31 coordinate sums, each of form 2 x+2y+ 1, we must get an odd number. If we add up the
coordinate sums of the 62 remaining squares, however, we must get an even number (because the
sum of the coordinate sums of all 64 squares is even by symmetry, and the two corners to subtract,
(1,1) and (8,8), have even sums). So, it cannot be done.

Table A.7 gives all the necessary information for you to solve the easier game
in which there are four cards of each color. It is worth noting that the recursive
deﬁnition of E(r, b), when seen in action in Table A.7, produces a complicated
Pascal’s triangle type of calculation when working from the lower right to
the upper left. That is, E(r, b) in each cell depends on E(r, b) in the cells
immediately to the right and below. As mentioned previously, in the two-,
four-, six-, and eight-card games, the expected payoﬀs are $1

If the additional remaining value in the deck when playing optimally is zero
[i.e., E(r, b) = 0], you are not indiﬀerent about continuing. Rather, you want
to quit immediately because in every case except one, E(r, b)=0i m p l i e s
r
r+b[1 + E(r−1,b)] +b
r+b[−1+E(r, b−1)] is negative, and that the “max”
function is being used in the recursive deﬁnition of E(r, b). The only exception
is when ( r, b)=( 1 ,2), and even thenr
r+b[1+E(r−1,b)]+b
r+b[−1+E(r, b−1)]
is zero and a risk-averse player would quit. When playing optimally, the last
card drawn is always red. That is, you never pick a black card and then quit.
The optimal score to quit at cannot be negative because you always have the
safety net of a zero payoﬀ for sure if you draw every card. The optimal score
to quit at is a non-increasing step function of the number of black cards drawn
(drawing red cards has no eﬀect on the optimal score to quit at). Drawing
black cards can lower the optimal score to quit at. In the eight-card game, the
optimal stopping rule is: If you have turned over zero or one black card, then
quit if you can get to a score of 2 without seeing another black card; if you
have turned over two or three black cards, then quit if you can get to a score of

The two ﬁzzing sparking ﬂames are going to burn toward each other and meet.
When they meet 60 seconds worth of fuse has been burnt in two sections that
each took the same amount of time. How much time? It has to be exactly
30 seconds because they both took the same time, and these times add to 60
seconds. Of course, you have to bend the fuse so that you can light both ends
simultaneously and when they meet it probably won’t be in the center of the

There are, in fact, an uncountably inﬁnite number of starting points that solve
this problem.
First of all, you could start at the north pole. On the middle leg of your walk
you would always be one mile south of the north pole, so the ﬁnal leg would
put you back where you started. Second, if you start at a point close to the
south pole but one mile north of a line of latitude having circumference one

mile, then the middle leg of your walk begins and ends in the same spot; the
ﬁnal leg takes you back to your starting point. There are inﬁnitely many such
starting points on the line of latitude that is one mile north of the line of
latitude having circumference one mile.
Similarly, if you start slightly further south, at a point one mile north of a
line of latitude having circumference one-half mile, then the middle leg of your
walk begins and ends in the same spot, and the ﬁnal leg returns you to your
starting point.
More generally, if you begin on a line of latitude one mile north of a line of
latitude having circumference 1 /nmiles, then you will walk one mile south,
circle the line of latitude ntimes, and return to your starting point.
In the latter case, how far is your starting point from the south pole? Well,
assume the Earth is perfectly spherical, and let Ebe its radius. Let rbe the
radius of the line of latitude having circumference 1 /nmiles, so, 2 πr=1/n.

Answer 1.66: Let us attack the mirror problem in stages.
Your Perspective, No Rotations: Put your wristwatch on your left wrist
and stand facing a mirror with your arms held out as though you are being
cruciﬁed (it is a tough interview remember). Your reﬂected self’s wristwatch-
bearing arm is pointing the same direction as yours. Your wristwatch is to
the left of your head, and your reﬂected self’s wristwatch is also to your left
of his or her head. There has been no ﬂipping of left for right. Similarly, if
your head is pointing up, then your reﬂected self’s head is also pointing up,
andthere has been no ﬂipping of up for down.
Perhaps this is clearer if you write a sentence on a transparent plastic sheet,
and hold the sheet in front of your body, as though there is no mirror at all
and you are simply reading what you have just written. Now look in the
mirror. The reﬂection of your sheet in the mirror is notreversed. That is, the
left-most word is still left most, the right-most word is still right most, and
you can still read the reﬂected image from left to right.
Viewed from your perspective, everything about you that is left, right, up,
or down is still left, right, up, or down, respectively, in your reﬂected image.
There is thus noﬂipping of left for right or up for down. What hasﬂipped
61It h a n kM a r kC a w s t o nf o rd i s c u s s i o n sr e g a r d i n gt h i sa n s w e r ;a n ye r r o r sa r em i n e .
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 167 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAPPENDIX A. PURELY QUANTITATIVE & LOGIC ANSWERS
is that if you are facing east, then your reﬂection is facing west. It does
not matter for the sentence written on the transparent sheet, because it has
no depth. It does matter for you, because your reﬂected nose is facing the
opposite direction.
Your Perspective, Rotation of Yourself: If your interviewer suggests that
there really is a ﬂipping left for right of your reﬂected self, but not up for down,
then this requires an implicit additional rotation of your perspective about a
vertical axis. In other words, suppose we can somehow physically ﬂip you
left for right, without changing the direction in which you are facing (ouch!).
Then, yes, both you and your reﬂection will be wearing your wristwatches on
your right hands. You and your reﬂection will, however, be facing in opposite
directions. So, to get a one-to-one mapping, we still need an additional rotation
of your body 180◦about a vertical axis. (Equivalently, we could rotate you
about the vertical axis ﬁrst, and then ﬂip you left for right).
Note that had we somehow physically ﬂipped you up for down (without chang-
ing the direction in which you are facing), then, yes, both you and your reﬂec-
tion will be wearing your wristwatches on your right hands. Like the previous
case, however, you and your reﬂection will still be facing in opposite directions.
So, to get a one-to-one mapping, we still need an additional rotation of your
body 180◦about a horizontal axis. (Equivalently, we could rotate you about
the horizontal axis ﬁrst, and then ﬂip you up for down).
The fact that neither a ﬂipping left for right nor a ﬂipping up for down (and
neither a rotation about a horizontal axis nor a rotation about a vertical axis)
alone suﬃces to provide a one-to-one mapping into the imagined boots of your
reﬂected self conﬁrms my earlier assertion: There is not a ﬂipping of left for
right, nor up for down, but rather, a ﬂipping in the direction of the depth.
If your interviewer ﬁrmly believes that a mirror does ﬂip left for right, then he
or she is predisposed toward rotation about a vertical axis (something many
of us do every day), and has not thought through the consequences of the
attempted one-to-one mapping.

Sbe the diameters of the three pizzas, respectively. We need only take half
of each pizza and lay the three halves on the table so that the corners touch
and the three diameters form a triangle. If the angle in the corner where the
small and medium pizzas touch is a right angle (check it using one corner of
the pizza box!), then L2=M2+S2holds by Pythagoras’ Theorem and the
two orders are equally attractive. If the angle is larger than a right angle, then
L2>M2+S2and the large pizza is the better deal. If the angle is smaller
than a right angle, then L2<M2+S2and the small pizza plus medium pizza
is the better deal. We could alternatively use a single slice from each pizza
(with side length equal to the radius of the circle) and form a triangle of side
lengths.

which makes sense.
Answer 1.72: Let us use the standard high school physics equations for linear
motion with constant acceleration. There are, however, two good reasons for
having a sensible guess before doing any math. First, if our calculations give
an answer that is wildly diﬀerent from our guess, then we have some baseline
ﬁgure for suspecting we may have made an error in the math. Second, if you
start with a guess, it may be that your interviewer will hold up a hand and say
“OK, ﬁne, let’s move to the next question.” He or she may just have wanted
to get an estimate out of you to see if you can estimate anything. They may
not be interested at all in whether you remember simple equations of motion.
So, I would say “Well, I can estimate it using equations for linear motion with
constant acceleration, but ﬁrst let me guess that it is something like ...ﬁve
seconds and 100 miles per hour” (or whatever your guess is).
Now, if we have to go on to the math, I would tell the interviewer that these
equations of motion ignore air resistance, and any updraft caused by wind hit-
ting the building. The penny may in fact reach “terminal velocity” (i.e., when
drag from the air resistance produces an upward force that perfectly counters
the force of gravity, and the penny stops accelerating). Even if it does not
reach terminal velocity, my estimate of speed will be an upper bound only
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 169 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAPPENDIX A. PURELY QUANTITATIVE & LOGIC ANSWERS
because the air resistance and updraft will slow the penny down.
Now, to do the math, we need to know how high the Empire State Building
is. From memory it is about 100 ﬂoors. Looking at the building I am sitting
in, I guess that each ﬂoor is probably about four meters, so let us assume it is
400 meters high.
Now, let vbe ﬁnal velocity, ube initial velocity (i.e., zero), Dbe the 400m
traveled, and tbe the time taken. We can use v2=u2+2·g·D,w h e r e
g=9.8m/s2≈10m/s2is the acceleration due to gravity. Then v2≈2·10·
400 = 8 ,000m2/s2,s ov≈90m/s(because 92=8 1 ,s o9 02=8,100). I keep
track of units so that I can do a “dimensional analysis” (i.e., so that I can
quickly conﬁrm that the units of the RHS match the units of the LHS).
Then we can use v=u+g·tto deduce that 90 ≈0+1 0 ·t,s ot≈9s.S o ,
it takes nine seconds, and it is traveling at 90 m/s when it hits the ground.
What is this in miles per hour (mph)? Well, we need to multiply by 60
and then again by 60 to get meters per hour, then divide by 1,609m/mile
to get miles per hour. I don’t even need the back of an envelope to get
90×60×60/1,609 = 324 ,000/1,609,but that’s very close to 320 ,000/1,600
which is just 200. So, it takes nine seconds and hits the ground at 200 miles
per hour. That’s not wildly diﬀerent from my initial guess, so I have no reason
to suspect any mathematics error. This is an upper bound on speed, and a
lower bound on time taken, but given air resistance and updraft, I would be
tempted to halve the calculated speed and double the time taken.
For comparison, a bullet leaves the muzzle of a gun at something like 2,000
feet/s. With roughly three feet to a meter, that is just over 600 m/s. So, our
penny’s upper bound on speed is roughly one-seventh of the speed of a bullet.

its lowest point.
We should check the second-order condition to conﬁrm that this is a minimum.
We can use the product rule and our ﬁrst derivative result.

So, we have found the minimum.
Note that when x<0,y=xxis not continuously real valued (nor is it a
uniquely-valued function; see Meyerson [1996]). There are, however, some
negative xvalues where y=xxis unambiguously real valued. For example,

Answer 1.77: If you ask, your interviewer will conﬁrm that he or she expects an
exact solution and not some estimate, that you are allowed to ﬂip any coin if
you wish, and that the two piles need not have the same number of coins in
each. Now go back and try again before peeking any further.
You know the total number of heads in the 100 coins is equal to 10. So,
suppose you form one pile of Ncoins, and one pile of 100 −Ncoins. Let us
assume that there are Hheads and N−Htails in the ﬁrst pile (but you do
not know H).
Thus there are 10 −Hheads in the second pile and 90 −(N−H) tails in the
second pile. How can you get the number of heads in each pile to be the same?
Well, you cannot balance Hand 10 −Hbecause you don’t (and can’t) know
what His.
What do you know? You know you can ﬂip any coin. What if you ﬂipped
every coin in one pile? There is, after all, some sort of constrained symmetry
going on here. Let’s say you ﬂip every coin in the ﬁrst pile. Then you have
N−Hheads in the ﬁrst pile. Can you choose Nso that the number of heads
in each pile is the same in that case, that is, N−H=1 0 −H?Y e s , c l e a r l y
choosing N=1 0d o e st h ej o b .
So, all you have to do is split the coins into a pile of 10 coins and a pile of
90 coins, and then ﬂip every coin in the pile of 10 coins. If you had chosen
instead to ﬂip every coin in the second pile (i.e., the pile of 100 −Ncoins),
the algebra would have yielded exactly the same solution (you should check
that).
If you get mixed up in the interview, just plug some numbers in. For example,
suppose you start oﬀ with 3 heads and 7 tails, say, in the pile of 10 coins,
then you must have 7 heads and 83 tails in the pile of 90 coins. You can see
immediately that ﬂipping every coin in the pile of 10 coins will give 7 heads
in each pile.
In practice, of course, you don’t know how many heads are in each pile, just
that they are the same number. You might even end up with zero heads in
each pile if you happened to initially move all 10 heads into the pile of 10
coins.
If the interviewer had asked instead for the same number of tails in each pile,
you would form a pile of 10 coins and a pile of 90 coins, and ﬂip every coin in

Answer 1.78: I will give two diﬀerent approaches to estimate π.T h e ﬁ r s t a p -
proach uses a simple Monte-Carlo simulation. The second uses the Leibniz
formula. Other techniques exist.
FIRST SOLUT ION
Simulate pairs of random variables ( x, y), each distributed uniform on the
unit interval [0 ,1]. These pairs, when plotted in two dimensions, populate
a unit square. A circle with unit diameter may be inscribed within the
unit square. I just need to count what proportion of points ( x, y)s a t i s f y
x2+y2≤1. The area of the circle dividend by the area of the unit square
isπ·r2/sl⎬sh⎭ig1= π·/p⎬renleft⎜ig
1
2/p⎬renright⎜ig2/sl⎬sh⎭igg
1= π/4. So, just multiply the relative proportion of
points within the circle by four. Even with sample size only 1,000,000, the
answer is generally accurate to within a tenth of a percentage point (i.e., ﬁrst
two decimal places correct).
SECOND SOLUT ION
The famous Leibniz formula for πis given in Equation A.20.63
π
4=∞/summ⎬tiondispl⎬y
n=0(−1)n
2n+1(A.20)
Cutting oﬀ Equation A.20 at n=1 0,000 yields an approximation accurate to
three decimal places (i.e., 3.14169264359053). Cutting it oﬀ at n= 10,000,000
is accurate to six decimal places (i.e., 3.14159275358978). Convergence is a
little slow.
Note, however, that the partial sums in Leibniz’s approximation (like many
numerical techniques for pricing options) bounces up and down as nincreases,
alternately overestimating and then underestimating π/4. Like acceleration
techniques for pricing options, using the average of two successive estimates
will therefore improve accuracy (Crack, 2021). So, let B(N)=4 ·/summ⎬tiontextN
n=0(−1)n
2n+1.
Then with N=1 0 ,000, [ B(N)+B(N−1)]/2 = 3 .14159264859028 ,which is
accurate to seven decimal places, or eight if you round. With N=1 0,000,000,
[B(N)+B(N−1)]/2 = 3 .14159265358979, which is accurate to 14 decimal
places.
Answer 1.79: The short answer is that sitting in any position from 1 o’clock to

©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 174 All Rights Reserved WorldwideThe setup of this problem is known as a “random walk on a circle. ” The solution
overlaps with the “gambler’s ruin” problem. So, I will describe how someone
seated at the table can win, in terms of the random walk on a circle, and then
I will remind you of the gambler’s ruin problem, and use its solution to solve
our problem.
Assume you are seated at the ithhour of the clock-table, for some 1 ≤i≤11.
Now imagine an arc painted on the outer edge of the clock-table, where the
arc records who has been visited by the prize as it is passed around. This
arc begins as a single blob of paint at the 12 o’clock position, but grows in
clockwise or counter-clockwise jumps as the prize is passed around. In order
for you, seated at the ithhour, to win the prize, every other guest has to touch
it before you. In order for this to happen, two speciﬁc events must happen.
First, the arc that records who has touched the prize so far must jump to
ap e r s o ns i t t i n gn e x tt oy o ua te i t h e rt h e( i−1)thor (i+1 )thhour. (Note
that we are counting modulo-12 here, with no zero. So, in the case i=1 ,
i−1=1 2a n dt h ea r ci sa l r e a d yt o u c h i n gt h e( i−1)thhour.) Indeed, the
game cannot conclude unless a person next to you touches the prize; this
happens with probability unity. Given the symmetry of the argument that is
about to follow, we can, without loss of generality, assume that the arc reaches
the ( i+1 )thhour before it reaches the ( i−1)thhour.
Second, if the arc has reached the ( i+1 )thhour before it reaches the ( i−1)th
hour (e.g., you are sitting at four o’clock, and the prize arrives at ﬁve o’clock,
not yet having arrived at three o’clock), then in order for you to win the prize,
the prize must walk right around the clock again, and reach the ( i−1)thhour
(three o’clock in my example) without landing in your hands in the interim.
No matter what happens next, you know that you have won the game if the
prize walks its way a net of 10 seats clockwise from the ( i+1 )thhour without
ever backtracking far enough to land in your hands. Another way to say this
is that if we count the net clockwise progress of the prize from the ( i+1 )th
hour, this net balance must reach 10 hours before it reaches −1h o u r s( n o t e
that reaching −1h o u r si sn o tn e e d e df o rt h eg a m et oc o n c l u d e ) .W ec a nn o w
use a gambler’s ruin argument to ﬁnd the probability of this event.
Suppose that you are a gambler with $10 in your hand. Your opponent has $1
in his hand. A fair coin is tossed repeatedly. If it is heads, you gain a dollar
from your opponent, and if it is tails you lose a dollar to your opponent. If your
wealth reaches $11 (i.e., your net balance increases by $1 and your opponent
is ruined), then the game stops and you win. If, however, your wealth reaches
$0 (i.e., your net balance drops by $10 and you are ruined), then the game
stops and your opponent wins.
The probability that you are ruined in this gamble is the same as the probabil-
ity that your opponent’s wealth steps up by a net change of $10, never having
reached a net change of −$1. Given that the advance-decline probabilities are
the same in both games (i.e., 50-50), the probability of your ruin is the same as

ruin, we have the answer to our clock-table game.
Consider a more general gambler’s ruin problem. You have $ nin your pocket
(in our case, $ n=1 0 ) . Y o u ro p p o n e n th a s$ min his pocket (in our case,
$m= 1). A fair coin is tossed repeatedly. If it is heads, you gain a dollar from
your opponent, and if it is tails you lose a dollar to your opponent. The game
continues until one of the players is ruined. Let P(i)b et h ep r o b a b i l i t yt h a ta
player with $ iin his hand is ultimately ruined playing exactly this game, for
0≤i≤n+m.
Now consider some intermediary balance $ iwhere 1 ≤i≤n+m−1. There
is half a chance that the next coin toss is favorable, and there is half a chance
that the next coin toss is unfavorable. So, by the total probability theorem,
we have Equation A.21.64
P(i)= P(ruin |favorable coin toss) ·P(favorable coin toss) +
P(ruin |unfavorable coin toss) ·P(unfavorable coin toss)
=P(i+1 ) ·1
2+P(i−1)·1
2(A.21)
Multiplying Equation A.21 through by 2 and rearranging, we get the second-
order recurrence in Equation A.22.
P(i+1 ) −2P(i)+P(i−1) = 0 ,for 1 ≤i≤n+m−1 (A.22)
To solve a second-order recurrence, we need two boundary conditions. In our
case, P(0) = 1 (you are already ruined), and P(n+m)=0( y o ua l r e a d yw o n ) .
The (homogeneous) characteristic equation for the recurrence in Equation A.22
is given by Equation A.23.
λ2−2λ+1=0 ( A . 2 3 )
This quadratic equation has repeated characteristic roots at λ0=1 . S o ,w e
are looking for solutions of the form given in Equation A.24.65
P(i)=A·1i+B·i·1i=A+B·i (A.24)
Plugging the boundary conditions into Equation A.24, we quickly deduce that
A=1a n d B=−1/(n+m). It follows that the probability of ruin is given
by Equation A.25.
P(i)=n+m−i
n+m(A.25)

positive semi-deﬁnite, or negative semi-deﬁnite, if under the same conditions
⃗z′A⃗z<0,⃗z′A⃗z≥0,or⃗z′A⃗z≤0,respectively. Matrices that are none of the
above are called indeﬁnite.
These deﬁnitions can also be given in terms of eigenvalues. A symmetric
n×nreal-valued matrix Ais positive deﬁnite, negative deﬁnite, positive semi-
deﬁnite, or negative semi-deﬁnite, respectively, if and only if all of the eigen-
values of Aare positive, negative, non-negative, or non-positive, respectively.
Indeﬁnite matrices have both positive and negative eigenvalues.

valued n×1 vectors ⃗z,t h er e a lp a r to f ⃗z∗A⃗z>0,where ⃗z∗is the complex
conjugate of the transpose of ⃗z.
All the above assumes that the matrix be symmetric (if real-valued) or Her-
mitian (if complex valued). The deﬁnition of a positive deﬁnite matrix
can, however, be generalized to non-symmetric and non-Hermitian matrices
(mathworld.wolfram.com ). In that case, the deﬁnition is applied only to the
symmetric part or Hermition part of the matrix, respectively.66
What about portfolio theory applications, theoretical and otherwise? In prac-
tice, portfolio optimization tools often assume that the VCV matrix is positive
deﬁnite (Kwan, 2010). For example, to obtain the standard Markowitz frontier
assuming short selling, you need that the variance-covariance (VCV) matrix
be invertible (Crack, 2020b). A positive deﬁnite matrix is invertible, but a
positive semi-deﬁnite matrix might have a zero eigenvalue, and therefore be
non-invertible.

If none of the eigenvalues is zero, then Vis also positive deﬁnite, and therefore
invertible. If ⃗zin Equation A.26 is a sensible vector of portfolio weights, then
⃗z′⃗Ris the future return to that portfolio. Note, however, that Equation A.26
does not require that ⃗zbe a sensible vector of portfolio weights.
Note that in the simple theoretical classroom example with only two assets,
an assumption of perfect negative correlation between their future returns
allows a zero-risk portfolio to be constructed (see Answer 3.20). In this case,
the population VCV matrix must be positive semi-deﬁnite, but not positive
deﬁnite (because weights can be chosen to create a zero-variance portfolio).
Thus, the population VCV matrix is non-invertible in this case (it must have
determinant zero, and a zero eigenvalue). What happens if the returns to the
two assets are assumed to be perfectly positively correlated?
Finally, in the case of the standard sample VCV matrix, ˆV,i fy o uh a v ef e w e r
time series observations than you have ﬁnancial assets in the cross section
(e.g., one year of daily observations on the S&P 500 stocks), then ˆVwill be
non-invertible, with at least one eigenvalue equal to zero. Note that numerical
issues with ﬁnite precision mean that in some cases, a sample VCV matrix
may even be negative deﬁnite.
Answer 1.81: In practice, how do you test whether a square matrix is positive
deﬁnite? You cannot possibly test whether ⃗z′A⃗z>0,for all non-zero ⃗z′.S o ,
let us look at several techniques. Then we will discuss which one is computa-
tionally easiest without using pre-canned routines.
First, I would like to use Sylvester’s criterion , but we need to review
some terms. A sub-matrix obtained by deleting the ithrow and the jthcolumn
of an n×nmatrix is an ( n−1)×(n−1) matrix. The determinant of this
sub-matrix is called a minor (or, more fully, a minor determinant of order
n−1), and is sometimes denoted Mi,j.I f a n y t w o r o w s {i1,i2}and any two
columns {j1,j2}are deleted, then the determinant of the resulting sub-matrix
is a minor of order n−2, denoted Mi1,i2,j1,j2,a n ds oo n . I ft h en u m b e r i n g
of the deleted row(s) is identical to the numbering of the deleted column(s),
then the determinant of the resulting sub-matrix is a principal minor (of order
k,w h e r e n−krows and the same n−kcolumns have been deleted). The
determinants of the upper-left sub-matrices, in particular, are known as the
“leading principal minors” (Ayers, 1962).
So, for example, for a 5 ×5m a t r i x ,d e l e t i n gt h eﬁ r s tr o wa n dt h eﬁ f t hc o l u m n
produces a sub-matrix whose determinant, M1,5,i sam i n o r . I ti sn o t ,h o w e v e r ,
a principal minor, leading or otherwise. Deleting the second row and the sec-
ond column of the original matrix produces a sub-matrix whose determinant,
M2,2, is a principal minor, but it is not a leading principal minor. Finally,
deleting rows k:5a n dc o l u m n s k:5 ,f o ra n y k∈{2,3,4,5}produces a sub-
matrix whose determinant, Mk:5,k:5,i sal e a d i n gp r i n c i p a lm i n o r . ( N o t et h a t
deleting no rows and no columns of the original matrix produces, trivially, a
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 178 All Rights Reserved Worldwidesub-matrix whose determinant is a minor, a principal minor, and a leading
principal minor.)
Now, Sylvester’s criterion says that a symmetric real-valued matrix Ais
positive deﬁnite if and only if the determinants of all m×mupper-left sub-
matrices (i.e., all leading principal minors) are positive (Gilbert, 1991). Sim-
ilarly, but slightly more taxing, a symmetric real valued matrix is positive
semi-deﬁnite if and only if allprincipal minors, leading or otherwise, are non-
negative (Swamy, 1973). So, in that case, the determinants of all sub-matrices
obtained by deleting any group of identically numbered rows and columns
must be non-negative.
For example, the matrix
A=⎛
⎜⎝123
256
369⎞
⎟⎠ (A.27)
has upper-left sub-matrices
(1),/p⎬renleft⎜igg
12
25/p⎬renright⎜igg
,and⎛
⎜⎝123
256
369⎞
⎟⎠.
The determinants of these three matrices (i.e., the leading principal minors)
are
M2:3,2:3=A11=1,
M3,3=A11A22−A21A12=1·5−2·2=1 ,and
+A11(A22A33−A23A32)−A12(A21A33−A23A31)+A13(A21A32−A22A31)=
+1(5 ·9−6·6)−2(2·9−6·3) + 3(2 ·6−5·3) = 0 .
In this case, the third leading principal minor is non-positive. So, by Sylvester’s
criterion, the matrix Ais not positive deﬁnite. Also, of course, in this case, the
overall determinant is zero, which implies that at least one of the eigenvalues
is zero (because the determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues).
So, the matrix Acannot be positive deﬁnite because not all of its eigenvalues
are positive.
Consider, however, the matrix B, diﬀering in only one element from A:
B=⎛
⎜⎝12 3
25 6
361 0⎞
⎟⎠. (A.28)
The matrix Bhas leading principal minors 1, 1, and 1, all positive (I leave
you to check that). So, by Sylvester’s criterion, Bis positive deﬁnite.
Second, in theory, you can calculate all eigenvalues of a matrix and
check whether they are positive. For matrices of small dimensions, this is

relatively straightforward. Given square matrix A, the eigenvalues λsolve
A⃗z=λ⃗z, for any non-zero ⃗z(Ayers, 1962). Rewriting yields ( λI−A)⃗z=0f o r
any non-zero ⃗zand conformal identity matrix I. This, in turn, requires that
the determinant of ( λI−A)e q u a l sz e r o .
For example, in the case of matrix Ain Equation A.27, solving det( λI−A)=0
yields the characteristic equation (i.e., the characteristic polynomial equated
to zero)
f(λ)=+ λ3−15λ2+1 0λ=0. (A.29)
Equation A.29 can be factored as f(λ)=λ(λ2−15λ+10) = 0 ,with eigenvalue
roots 0 ,(15 +√

2,(15−√

2.The eigenvalues are non-negative,
but one is zero. So, Ais positive semi-deﬁnite, but not positive deﬁnite.
In contrast, in the case of matrix Bin Equation A.28, solving det( λI−B)=0
yields the characteristic equation
f(λ)=+ λ3−16λ2+1 6λ−1=0 . (A.30)
Equation A.30 can be factored as f(λ)=( λ−1)(λ2−15λ+1) = 0 ,with eigen-
value roots 1 ,(15 +√
221)/sl⎬sh⎜ig
2,(15−√
221)/sl⎬sh⎜ig
2.We can see that the eigenval-
ues are all positive. So, the matrix Bis positive deﬁnite.
Let me add some notes here. As an exercise, can you conﬁrm, for each of
matrices AandB,t h a tt h ep r o d u c to ft h ee i g e n v a l u e se q u a l st h ed e t e r m i n a n t ,
and the sum of the eigenvalues equals the trace? Note also that the diagonal
elements of a real-valued symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix must be positive
(just take ⃗zto be the unit vector with a 1 in the ithposition to see that diagonal
terms Aii=⃗z′A⃗z>0f o re a c h i). Can you conﬁrm also that the characteristic
polynomial is monic (i.e., the coeﬃcient of λnis one), the coeﬃcient of λn−1
is−1·trace, where trace is the trace of the matrix, and the constant is ( −1)n·
determinant, where determinant is the determinant of the matrix?
Third, we may be able to use Descartes’ rule of signs without actually
solving for all eigenvalues. For example, Looking at Equation A.30, we see that
there are three sign changes in the coeﬃcients. The number of positive roots
of the characteristic polynomial (counting multiple roots separately) is either
equal to the number of sign changes between consecutive non-zero coeﬃcients,
or it is less than that by an even number (Spiegel, 1956). In the case of
Equation A.30, there must be either three or one positive root. Conversely,
if we look at f(−λ), we see that there are no sign changes in the coeﬃcients.
So, the count of negative roots equals zero. Clearly λ= 0 is not a root of
Equation A.30, so we deduce that there must be exactly three positive roots,
without actually having to factor the polynomial.
Fourth, you can use a Cholesky factorization (or decomposition)
of the matrix. Suppose that Ais a symmetric positive deﬁnite real-valued
matrix. Then Amay be factored, or decomposed, as A=U′Uwhere Uis a
unique upper-triangular matrix (or, equivalently, as A=LL′,w h e r e L=U′
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 180 All Rights Reserved Worldwideis a unique lower-triangular matrix) with real positive diagonal entries (Press
et al., 1996, p. 96–97; Bronshtein et el., 2004, p. 890).67This decomposition
is sometimes referred to as taking the square root of the matrix (Press et al.,
1996, p. 96). Then, for real-valued ⃗z,⃗z′A⃗z=⃗z′(U′U)⃗z=(U⃗z)′(U⃗z)=⃗y′⃗y=
∥⃗y∥2

i≥0, for the n×1 vector ⃗y≡U⃗z.68If⃗z̸=0 ,t h el a t t e r

Matrix Amust be positive deﬁnite, given the above decomposition, because
ifU, in the Cholesky decomposition, has positive real diagonal entries, then
Uis invertible.69It follows that U⃗z=0i fa n do n l yi f ⃗z=0( j u s tm u l t i p l y
through by U−1). It follows that ⃗z′A⃗z=0i fa n do n l yi f ⃗z=0 ,a n dt h u st h a t
Ais positive deﬁnite.
So, how in practice do we obtain the matrix Uin the Cholesky decomposition?
Consider our matrix Ain Equation A.27. Rewrite it as in Equation A.31

composition appear roughly equally easy to program from scratch and would
consume essentially no computing time. Solving for all eigenvalues is easy
enough for matrices no larger than 4 ×4, but Descartes’ rule of signs might
fail to be speciﬁc enough to conclude whether a matrix is positive deﬁnite. For

Cholesky decomposition is likely to be the most eﬃcient means of determining
whether a matrix is positive deﬁnite.
Answer 1.82: To identify local extrema of a function of two variables, we need
to conduct the second (partial) derivative test (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1972,
p. 14; Spiegel, 1981, p. 164). Let me review the test procedure, and then we
can apply the test to the case f(x, y)=x3+y3−2xy.
Suppose that f(x, y) is a function of two variables whose second partial deriva-
tives exist. Then Equation A.37 gives the Hessian matrix of f(x, y).
H(x, y)=⎛
⎜⎝∂2f(x,y)

Suppose now that ( xc,yc)i sac r i t i c a lp o i n to ft h ef u n c t i o n f(x, y). That is,

•Iffis a function of three or more variables, then the determinant of H
does not carry enough information for us to discriminate between cases.
Instead, we need to look at whether His positive deﬁnite (local mini-
mum), negative deﬁnite (local maximum), indeﬁnite (saddle point), or
either positive semi-deﬁnite or negative semi-deﬁnite (inconclusive).
•Note that the ﬁrst two rules in the list use the sign of fxx(x, y)t od i s t i n g u i s h
between a local minimum and a local maximum. For the two-variable
case, let λ1and λ2be the eigenvalues of H. Recall, as discussed on
p. 180, that the product of the eigenvalues equals the determinant, and
the sum of the eigenvalues equals the trace. That is,
trace( H)= fxx(x, y)+fyy(x, y)=λ1+λ2
det(H)= fxx(x, y)fyy(x, y)−[fxy(x, y)]2=λ1·λ2.
From our discussion in Answer 1.80, however, we know that His positive
deﬁnite if and only if λ1,λ2>0. This condition is equivalent to having
λ1·λ2>0a n d λ1>0, or λ1·λ2>0a n d λ1+λ2>0, or λ1·λ2>0
andλ2>0. So, the ﬁrst rule, “If D(xc,yc)>0a n d fxx(xc,yc)>0,
then ( xc,yc)i sal o c a lm i n i m u mo ft h ef u n c t i o n f(x, y)” can, in fact,
be re-stated using either fxx(x, y)>0, or fyy(x, y)>0, or trace( H)=
fxx(x, y)+fyy(x, y)>0. You should conﬁrm that the second, third, and
fourth rules refer directly to the signs of the eigenvalues needed to ensure
that His negative deﬁnite, indeﬁnite, or semi-deﬁnite, respectively.
•Note that D(x, y)a n d fxx(x, y) are the leading principal minors of H(x, y)
(see Answer 1.81 for discussion of Sylvester’s criterion). So, for exam-
ple, conﬁrming that these are both positive conﬁrms that His positive
deﬁnite.
•In the case that the second derivative test is inconclusive, further analysis is
required. You may need to look at behavior of higher-order derivatives at
the critical point, or you may need to think geometrically. For example,
consider the simple function f(x, y)=x2+y2.A l t h o u g h t h i s i s a v e r y
simple case, the function is so ﬂat at the origin that we have D(0,0) = 0,
and the second derivative test is inconclusive (try plotting f(x, y)=x2n+
y2nfor any small positive integer nto see this ﬂatness accentuated; the
test in inconclusive in these cases too). Direct inspection, however, tells
us that f(x, y)=x2+y2is cup-shaped with a global minimum at (0 ,0)
(in fact, it is an elliptic paraboloid).

Answer 1.83: At ﬁrst glance, this sounds like a statistics question. I put it in this
chapter, however, because it follows naturally from the previous two questions
about matrices and their properties. I discuss two solution techniques. The
ﬁrst uses Sylvester’s criterion, and the second uses eigenvalues.

What about ρ=−1. Well it is perfectly feasible for X1andX2to be perfectly
negatively correlated, and for X2andX3to be perfectly negatively correlated,
but then X1andX3would be perfectly positively correlated. So, ρ=−1i s
not possible. So, at ﬁrst glance, it looks like positive correlations ρare feasible,
but we cannot step too far into negative territory.
Now, given any correlation matrix, C, for three random variables X1,X2,X3,
Cis also the VCV matrix for the random variables Z1,Z2,Z3,w h e r e Zi≡
(Xi−µi)/σi,f o ri=1,2,3 (via simple reasoning from ﬁrst principals as men-
tioned when referring to Question 4.9, above). That is, any correlation matrix
is also a VCV matrix for the standardized variables.
We know, however, from Answer 1.80, that any population VCV matrix must
be positive semi-deﬁnite (see the discussion on p. 177, just before Equa-
tion A.26).
We know, from Sylvester’s criterion, that a matrix is positive semi-deﬁnite if
and only if all principal minors are non-negative (see discussion on p. 179).
That is, the determinants of all sub-matrices obtained by deleting same-
numbered rows and columns in Care non-negative. There are seven such
sub-matrices, but only three unique ones, as shown in Equation A.44.

Answer 1.84: The point of this question is not for you to give a formal deﬁnition
of an integral, or a rundown of diﬀerent types of integrals, but rather to provide
an opportunity for you to demonstrate simple/deep intuition.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 187 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAPPENDIX A. PURELY QUANTITATIVE & LOGIC ANSWERS
There are many diﬀerent types of integrals (Riemann, Lebesgue, Itˆ o, etc.).
There are many diﬀerent applications (pure calculus, probabilistic applica-
tions, stochastic calculus, etc.). I think the best answer is to give some simple
examples and counter examples. Although the following is a relatively low-
level explanation, I have spoken with a surprising number of mathematics
majors who had never seen this basic intuition.
Example 1: Consider the integral in Equation A.49.
/integr⎬ldispl⎬yx=4
x=3x2dx (A.49)
Equation A.49 is a particular case of the more general integral in Equa-
tion A.50./integr⎬ldispl⎬yx=b
x=af(x)dx (A.50)
Ia mc o n ﬁ d e n tt h a tm o s tp e o p l er e a d i n gt h i sb o o kc a nd r i v ean u m e r i c a la n s w e r
to Equation A.49 in 30 seconds or less. That is unimpressive. Can you,
however, read Equation A.49 or Equation A.50 (or much more complicated
integrals) as ﬂuently as you can read this sentence?
When I see the integral in Equation A.49, I read it on two levels. First, I read
it at the simple mechanical level that an advanced high school student reads
it, and can calculate it. Second, I read it like reading a sentence. Please see
Figure A.7, Equation A.51, and the discussion following for details.
Regarding Figure A.7 and Equation A.51, note that the Latin letter “S”, the
Greek capital letter sigma, “Σ”, and the integral sign “/integr⎬ltext”, have in common
that they denote the ﬁrst letter in the word “summation.” My understanding
is that when mathematicians needed a symbol for summation in a continuous
setting they were running out of choices. So, they took a standard letter “S”
and grabbed the top and the bottom and stretched it out to get the integral
sign in Equation A.51.
I read Equations A.49, A.50, or A.51, like a sentence. Each is the limiting
value of a summation of the products of height times width, where the limit
is taken as the width of the slices tends to zero (or the count of the slices
between given limits tends to inﬁnity). In my head, I picture the summation
for any particular choice of the value of wi,a n dIi m a g i n et h a ts u mt e n d i n gt o
the integral in the limit, yielding the area between the curve and the x-axis.
My fourth example, below, gives, however, a counter example.
For any given ﬁnite step length wi,t h eﬁ n i t es u m m a t i o ni sa na p p r o x i m a t i o nt o
the integral (you can see the approximation at the top of the shaded region in
Figure A.7). As the width of the narrow slices tends to zero, the approximation
becomes more accurate, yielding exactly the integral in the limit as wi→0.
We are free to read the integral sign in Equation A.51 as “sum” or “summation”
as long as we understand it is so only in the limiting sense as the width wi
goes to zero.

Story: “We had narrowed our search for a senior-level executive at a major
ﬁnancial institution to three candidates and felt that one in particular was
the best choice in terms of experience and background. We prepped all
three for their interviews with the company’s general counsel, but we really
spent time prepping the top candidate. When he got into the interview, it
suddenly seemed he’d come from another planet. He asked about his oﬃce
furniture, his expense-account allowances and health-care plan. He asked
nothing whatsoever about the functions of the job and his qualiﬁcations for
it. I sat there in horror. ”

Example 2: Consider again the integral in Equation A.49, but this time,
calculate it algebraically. Let us begin with a guess, work it out analytically,
using the rules we learned in high school, and then work it out algebraically
(which is where the rules we learned come from anyway).
The function f(x)=x2forx∈[3 4] ranges from 9 to 16. We can guess that the
area under the curve between these limits is roughly height (i.e., approximately
16+9
2) times base (i.e., 1). This yields the estimate 12.5.

Like numeric diﬀerentiation, in theory, this algebraic integration can be exe-
cuted for any integrable function. In practice, it can get algebraically messy—
but a computer can easily perform this sort of numeric integration using mind-
less CPU cycles.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 190 All Rights Reserved WorldwideExample 3: When dealing with probability, the intuitive approach to in-
tegrals in Example 1 needs to be modiﬁed. If Xhas pdf fX(x), then the
expected value of X(i.e., the mean of X) is denoted E(X)a n di sg i v e nb y
Equation A.52.
E(X)=/integr⎬ldispl⎬y
xfX(x)dx. (A.52)
Do we have simple intuition for the integral in Equation A.52? Well, suppose
we were to follow the intuition from Example 1, above. Then, we could deﬁne
g(x)≡x·fX(x), and we could think of E(X)=/integr⎬ltextg(x)dxas the limiting value
of/summ⎬tiontext
iarea i,w h e r ea r e a i=g(xi)·width i=hi·wi, as before. Although correct,
this is deﬁnitely not the most intuitive way to look at an expected value. This
approach ignores the special properties of the pdf fX(x).
Instead, recall ﬁrst that if Xdis a discrete random variable, taking values
xiwith probability pi,t h e n E(Xd)=/summ⎬tiontexti=n
i=1xi·pi.T h e c o n t i n u o u s c a s e i n
Equation A.52 is, in fact, perfectly analogous to this simple discrete case.
That is, if we now look back at Figure A.7, and consider the special case where
the function f(x)i sap d fg i v e nb y fX(x), then the area under fX(x), be it
exact or approximated, is a lump of probability mass. So, the term fX(x)·dx
appearing under the integral sign in Equation A.52 is just an inﬁnitesimal
lump of probability mass. That is, fX(x)·dxis the area of an (inﬁnitesimally
thin) small vertical slice taken under the pdf of X(with height fX(x)a n d
inﬁnitesimal width dx). The sum of all such areas is equal to one by deﬁnition

Example 4: Finally, in each of the above three examples, I deﬁned the integral
as the limiting value of a discrete summation, with the limit taken as the width
of small steps in the discretization of the x-axis tends to zero. Embedded
within this intuition is the notion of convergence. For example, no matter

limiting value as the widths of the discrete probability masses goes to zero.
This, however, is not always the case.
For example, the standard Cauchy distribution is deﬁned as the ratio of in-
dependent standard normals. The standard Cauchy is also known as the
Lorentz or Breit-Wigner distribution. Although, to the untrained eye, the
standard Cauchy distribution looks quite “normal,” the standard Cauchy dis-
tribution has such fat tails relative to a standard normal distribution that
diﬀerent discretizations can yield diﬀerent answers for the limiting value of
the probability-weighted values of the random variable. That is, the integral
E(C) is not convergent when Cfollows a standard Cauchy distribution.
The standard Cauchy distribution is the same thing as a t-distribution with
one degree of freedom (Crack, 2020b). This can be seen because, by deﬁnition,
at-distribution with one degree of freedom is the ratio of a standard normal
to the square root of a statistically independent chi-squared distribution with
one degree of freedom sitting on its degrees of freedom, t1∼Z/sl⎬sh⎜ig/r⎬dic⎬l⎜ig
χ2
1/sl⎬sh⎭ig1. B y
deﬁnition, a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom is, however,
just a standard normal distribution squared. Combining all these, we see
that t1∼Z1/Z2∼C,w h e r e Cis standard Cauchy. (Note that whether the
denominator is the unsigned/r⎬dic⎬l⎜ig

as t a n d a r dC a u c h y . )
Thet-distribution may be thought of as bridging the gap between the standard
Cauchy distribution and the standard normal distribution. That is, as the
degrees of freedom increase from ν=1t o ν=∞,t h eS t u d e n t - twith ν
degrees of freedom deforms continuously from the ill-behaved standard Cauchy
distribution to the well-behaved standard normal distribution
The very fat tails of the standard Cauchy distribution are attributable to the
probability mass near zero in the denominator of the ratio C=Z1/Z2.V e r y
small values of the denominator amplify the numerator so signiﬁcantly that
the convergence of the integral we discussed in Figure A.7 and Equation A.53
fails.72That is, depending upon how we calculate the limit as the widths of
the slices of probability mass in the integral go to zero, we can get diﬀerent
answers. The convergence fails so badly that no central moments exist for the
standard Cauchy distribution. To be precise, the odd raw moments (including
the mean) do not exist at all, the even raw moments do exist but are inﬁnite,
and because the central moments (e.g., the variance) require the mean, no
central moments exist.
72This ampliﬁcation eﬀect is ameliorated somewhat in the case of the t-distribution with degrees
of freedom ν>1, because there is less probability mass near zero in the denominator in that case.
Nevertheless, the Student- twith ν= 2 still has inﬁnite variance—but at least the variance is deﬁned
in that case. The fat tails at low degrees of freedom mean that the Student- tdistribution requires
ν≥3 to get ﬁnite variance, ν≥4 to get ﬁnite skewness (which is equal to zero), and ν≥5 to get
ﬁnite kurtosis.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 192 All Rights Reserved WorldwideThe bottom line is that our intuition for what an integral is must also include
ill-behaved cases where the integral is not convergent.
Answer 1.85: Following on from our previous answer about integrals, E[g(X)]
may be interpreted as a probability-weighted average of values of g(X), where
X∼N(µ, σ2). A Monte-Carlo simulation does not discretize the domain of
the pdf (though that would work too), but rather it relies upon the strong law
of large numbers.
Khinchine’s Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) says that if the sample
Y1,Y2,...,Y N,...are IID with E(Yi)=µY(a ﬁnite number) for each i,t h e n ,
with probability one,
¯Yn≡1
NN/summ⎬tiondispl⎬y
i=1Yi→µY,asn→∞.
That is, in plain English, the sample mean approaches the true mean as the
sample size increases.
So, all we have to do is sample Nvalues xifrom N(µ, σ2) via computer
program, and calculate
/hatwiderE[g(X)] =1

i=1g(xi).
Convergence is guaranteed because the g(xi)a r eI I Dw i t he x p e c t e dv a l u e s
E[g(X)].
Typical values of Nare of the order of 10,000 or 20,000. Standard central
limit theorem results allow us to put a conﬁdence interval about our estimator.
Large sample sizes give narrower conﬁdence intervals.
Answer 1.86: When I saw 29 ×29, I immediately noticed that 29 is only 1 less
than 30. I know that 30 ×30 = 900, so all I have to do is add 29 and 30 (to
get 59) and then subtract that from 900 to get 841. Let me explain...
You likely already know that a2−b2=(a+b)(a−b). In the case that a=b+1,
this reduces to a2−b2=a+b.T h ef a c tt h a t2 9i so n el e s st h a n3 0 ,a n dt h a t

Alternatively, just multiply it out and add the parts:

40×40 = 1 ,600,

Answer 1.89: You need only ask for a single piece of fruit to deduce the correct
labeling. If you are peeking here for a hint, then go back and ask yourself how
it can be done with only a single piece of fruit.
Given the symmetry of the problem, my initial instinct was that asking for
fruit from the barrel labeled “Apples,” or the one labeled “Oranges,” was not
going to solve the problem.
If you ask for a single piece of fruit from the barrel labeled “Apples and
Oranges,” then, given the mis-labeling, you know that every other piece of
fruit in that barrel is the same as the piece you requested. So, suppose you are
handed an apple from this barrel. Then, you have located the true “Apples”
barrel, currently labeled “Apples and Oranges. ” Given that you now know
where the true “Apples” barrel is, then you now know that the barrel labeled
“Oranges” cannot be the true “Apples” barrel. By construction, however, the
barrel labeled “Oranges” also cannot be the true “Oranges” barrel (because
every barrel is mis-labeled). Therefore, the barrel labeled “Oranges” must be
the true “Apples and Oranges” barrel (there is no other choice remaining).
Thus, we deduce that the remaining barrel, labeled “Apples,” must be the
true “Oranges” barrel.
Another way to think about the problem is that once you have identiﬁed that
the barrel labeled “Apples and Oranges” contains only apples, then you can
unpin the “Apples” label from its barrel, remove the “Apples and Oranges”
label, and pin the “Apples” label in its correct place. This leaves you with a
correctly labeled “Apples” barrel, an unlabeled barrel, an incorrectly labeled
“Oranges” barrel, and the “Apples and Oranges” label in your hand. You
know that the “Oranges” label has to move, and that the unlabeled barrel is
the only place to pin it. So, having done that, you can then pin the “Apples
and Oranges” label on the remaining barrel.
Of course, if at the initial step you are instead handed an orange from the
barrel labeled “Apples and Oranges,” then the argument is analogous (i.e., the
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 194 All Rights Reserved Worldwide“Apples and Oranges” barrel holds only oranges, and the “Apples” barrel can
then be neither oranges nor apples, etc.).
Note that if you instead request the initial piece of fruit from the barrel labeled
“Apples” or the barrel labeled “Oranges,” then the only-a-single-piece-of-fruit-

Answer 1.90: To compare 112.5with 400, I am going to square both sides and
ask how 115compares with 4002.I c a n q u i c k l y ﬁ g u r e t h a t 4 0 02is a 16 with
four zeroes after it. So, I will be looking at the leading digits of 115to see how
they compare with 16.
The number 11 has nice properties. For example, I know that 112= 121. In
fact, any number made just of ones, when squared, gives what I will call a
“podium” number. For example, 1 ,1112=1,234,321.
I have also memorized that 113=1,331. So, to get 115, I need to multiple
1,331 and 121 in my head. I can picture that (and I don’t know about you,
but I have to close my eyes for this one) I am going to have to add 133,100,
26,620, and 1,331. Subtracting 100,000 from the ﬁrst term and dropping any
thing smaller than 1,000, leaves me with 33,000, 26,000, and 1,000 which add
to give 60,000. So, adding back in the numbers I dropped, which I am not
going to actually bother doing, brings the grand sum to just over 160,000.
Thus, 112.5is a little bit bigger than 400.
Answer 1.91: The interviewer told you that the lengths of two sides of a triangle
are 5 and 6, and asked you for the length of the third side. Let the two sides
have angle θbetween them, then for 0◦<θ< 180◦,t h et h i r ds i d eh a sl e n g t h
1<L< 11, respectively. You get equality only in the degenerate case of a
triangle with no area (i.e., when θ=0◦,180◦).
If the interviewer meant that it is a right-angle triangle (i.e., θ= 90◦), then we
can use Pythagoras’ Theorem to ﬁnd L2=52+62=6 1 ,a n dt h u s L=√

Answer 1.92: Let me try a step-by-step approach. I know that the doubles (1 ,1)
and (2 ,2) are needed. So, each die needs a 1 and a 2. I need a 0 somewhere.
So, let me start with {0,1,2}and{1,2}.I t r i e d a d d i n g 3 , 4 , 5 , a n d 6 t o

could not get (0 ,7) or (0 ,8). I could, however, get (0 ,9) by inverting the 6.
Using that logic, let us drop the 6 and replace it with a 0: {0,1,2,7,8,9}and
{0,1,2,3,4,5}. I can see other equally-good choices obtained by any shuﬄing
of the 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

minute to toast each side. Place slices A, B and C in the pan for
one minute; then ﬂip over slices A and B, while holding out slice

oﬀ slices C and D (taking a third minute).
Let us think in terms of sides of bread. In one minute, the pan can toast three
(or fewer) sides of toast simultaneously. Four pieces of bread possess only eight
sides, so it seems reasonable to expect that if we take three minutes and use
the pan three times (i.e., enough to toast nine sides), we should be able to do
the job. In fact, in three minutes, we should be able to toast all four slices of
bread on both sides, and also toast half of one more slice. It is just a matter
of ﬁguring out how to do so, subject to the constraint that we cannot toast
both sides of any one slice simultaneously.
Let us label the four slices of bread as A,B,C,a n d D,a n dt h e i rs i d e sa s1

Answer 1.95: I give two related proofs that inﬁnitely many prime numbers exist.
FIRST SOLUT ION
Euclid gives a proof in about 300BC (Euclid, 2008, Book 9, Proposition 20).
Given a ﬁnite list of prime numbers p1,p2,...,p N,l e tΠ= p1·p2···pNbe
their product. Consider (Π + 1); either (Π + 1) is a prime number or it is
not. If (Π + 1) is a prime number, then our ﬁnite list of prime numbers was
incomplete, for (Π+1) is yet another. If (Π+1) is not a prime number, then it
is a composite number (i.e., a non-prime number). All composite numbers are
divisible by a prime number (Euclid, 2008, Book 7, Proposition 31). Let this
prime divisor be p.T h e n pcannot be one of p1,p2,...,p N.F o r ,i f i t w e r e ,s a y ,
p=pi, then (Π + 1) would be divisible by pi,b u tΠ( b yi t sv e r yd e ﬁ n i t i o n )i s
also divisible by pi.I n t h i s c a s e ,i t f o l l o w s t h a t 1 = ( Π + 1 ) −Πi sa l s od i v i s i b l e
bypi, which is absurd. Thus our ﬁnite list of prime numbers was incomplete,
forpis yet another.
In other words, given any ﬁnite list of prime numbers, yet another prime
number can be found. So, there must be inﬁnitely many prime numbers.

SECOND SOLUT ION
Suppose you are given some positive integer n>2. Consider n!=n·(n−
1)···2·1. Without loss of generality, n! is divisible by each of 2, 3, ...,n.
(So, n! is not prime.) Now consider ( n!+1 ) . E i t h e r( n!+1 )i sp r i m e , o ri t
is not prime. For example, (11! + 1) = 39 ,916,801 is prime, but (12! + 1) =
479,001,601 is not prime.
If (n! + 1) is prime, then we have discovered a prime number larger than the
given n.I f (n!+1) is not prime, then it is a composite number, and is therefore
divisible by a prime number. We know, however, that ( n! + 1) is not divisible
by any of 2, 3, . . . , n(because it has remainder 1 when divided by any of
these numbers, by construction). So, ( n! + 1) must be divisible by a prime
number larger than n. Again, we have discovered a prime number larger than
the given n.
It follows that given any positive integer n>2, we can ﬁnd a prime number
larger than n. So, there must be inﬁnitely many prime numbers.
Answer 1.96: Following on from the answer to the previous question, let us use
factorials to construct a sequence of nconsecutive positive integers none of
which is prime.73Given positive integer n, without loss of generality, consider
the following nsuccessive numbers:
[(n+1 ) !+2 ] ,[(n+1 ) !+3 ] ,[(n+1 ) !+4 ] ,...,[(n+1 ) !+( n+1 ) ] .
The ﬁrst number is divisible by 2, the second number is divisible by 3, and so
on, up until the nthnumber which is divisible by ( n+1 ) . I tf o l l o w st h a tn o n e
of these nconsecutive numbers is prime, which was to be shown.
Note that the ﬁrstnumber at which a run of nsuccessive composite numbers
begins may be much lower than [( n+ 1)! + 2]. For example, when n=3 ,s u r e
enough [(3 + 1)! + 2] = (4! + 2) = 26, and 26, 27, 28 are consecutive composite
numbers, but so too are 8, 9, 10.
Answer 1.97: Can the mean of two consecutive prime numbers be prime? No,
of course not. Replace the word “prime” with any other word, and the answer
is still no. If they are consecutive, then by deﬁnition there are none of them
in between!
73I thank Paul Bilokon for this proof; any errors are mine.

Derivatives Answers
This appendix contains answers to the questions posed in Chapter 2.
Answer 2.1: Most people incorrectly deduce that the call option is worthless.
If this is your conclusion, then you have been bumped by the pickpocket’s
accomplice again (see story on p. 286). You missed the point. So, stop looking
at the answers and go back and think again.
Many people think that zero volatility means the stock price is going nowhere.
However, volatility of returns is, by deﬁnition, the average deviation from
expected returns. It follows that zero volatility means the stock price drifts
up at the expected return on the stock with no deviations from this path.
With no volatility, the stock is riskless. In the absence of arbitrage opportuni-
ties, the stock must oﬀer an expected return equal to the riskless rate. This is
true in both the real world and the theoretical risk-neutral world. This result
(expected return equals r) is very strange in the real world—stocks normally
oﬀer higher returns. Do note, however, that allstocks in the risk-neutral world
have expected return equal to the riskless rate. Although I discuss option pric-
ing in the risk-neutral world, the same arguments apply in the real world in
the no-volatility case.1
The required rate of return on the stock is the riskless interest rate. It follows
that with no volatility, the stock price rises to about $105 for sure.2That is,
the option ﬁnishes in-the-money for sure and is thus riskless. The discounted
expected payoﬀ is thus roughly($105 −$100)
1.05=5
1.05.A t5 % ,y o ul o s ea b o u tﬁ v e
cents on every dollar when you discount over a year. The discounted expected
payoﬀ is, therefore, about $4.75, and this is the call value.
1If option pricing is done using real world probabilities rather than risk-neutral ones, then the
discount rate on the option is a path-dependent random variable that changes as the stock price
changes (Arnold and Crack [2004]; Arnold, Crack and Schwartz [2009, 2010]). Such a model allows
inference of real world probabilities of a real option project being successful, a ﬁnancial option
ﬁnishing in-the-money, or a corporate bond defaulting.
2If the interest rate is an eﬀective (i.e., simple) rate, then this is exact; if it is continuously
compounded, this is an approximation.

This is a good place to mention an often overlooked connection between options
and forwards. Suppose that S(t) is the price today of a stock that pays no
dividends. Let rdenote the continuously compounded interest rate per annum.
Then a fair price for delivery of the stock at time Tis:F=S(t)er(T−t).I n t h e
absence of volatility, the expected time- Tstock price is just the forward price.
Once volatility is introduced into the picture, the distribution of terminal

which is also unchanged: S(t)er(T−t). That is, the expected time- Tstock
price in the risk-neutral world is just the forward price.
Back to our option: With no volatility, the value of the option at time tis just
the discounted expected time- Tpayoﬀ in a risk-neutral world:
c(t)= e−r(T−t)max( S(T)−X,0)
=e−r(T−t)max( S(t)er(T−t)−X,0)
=e−r(T−t)max( F−X,0),
where F=S(t)er(T−t)is the forward price for the stock, and Xis the strike
price. If follows that the option has value if and only if the forward price
exceeds the option’s strike.
How do you hedge this? If F>X ,t h eo p t i o nw i l lﬁ n i s hi n - t h e - m o n e yf o rs u r e ,
so you need a delta of +1. If F≤X,t h eo p t i o nw i l ld i ew o r t h l e s sf o rs u r e ,s o
you need a delta of 0 (who would buy the option in this case anyway?).
Answer 2.2: The gamma of an option is the rate of change of its delta, ∆, with
respect to stock price—denoted Γ. Option gamma is also called “curvature,” or
“convexity.” Gamma is non-negative for standard puts and calls (their deltas
rise with increasing S). Put-call parity tells us that the gamma of a European
call is the same as the gamma of a European put.
Option value “decays” toward kinked ﬁnal payoﬀ as expiration approaches (see
Figure B.1—ﬁrst panel). This time decay is called “theta. ” We usually think
about theta as being negative for plain vanilla options, but there are two clear
exceptions. A deep in-the-money European-style call can have positive theta
if the dividend yield is high enough—because high dividends can push price
down below intrinsic value and the option then has to “decay upward” in value
as expiration approaches. Similarly, a deep in-the-money European put decays
upward in value—because life does not get much better than a deep-in-the-
money American put, but the European put cannot be exercised immediately
and hence the discount. Crack (2021) discusses this in more detail.
Theta is large and negative for at-the-money options, and it increases in mag-
nitude as maturity approaches. Theta and gamma are typically of opposing
signs (the positive theta cases mentioned above are exceptions), so large neg-
ative theta typically goes hand-in-hand with large positive gamma. That is,
shortening maturity accelerates at-the-money option prices towards the kink
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 200 All Rights Reserved Worldwideand also gives more curvature (i.e., gamma) in the plot of option value as a
function of stock price (see Figure B.1—third panel).
The maturity/gamma relationship is reversed away from the strike price. If a
call is deep in-the-money, then ∆ →1, as expiration approaches (for a deep in-
the-money put,∆→−1 as expiration approaches). Thus, short maturity calls
or puts that are deep in-the-money have deltas that do not vary much as S
changes. With little variation in delta, the gamma is close to zero. If an option
is instead deep out-of-the-money, then its gamma is also close to zero because
its delta is close to zero with little variation across S. It follows that for away-
from-the-money standard options, shorter maturity implies lower gamma for
both puts and calls (see Figure B.1—third panel).
The gamma (i.e., convexity) for a standard European call on a stock that pays

With ( T−t)>0, the formula for Γ shows that as S(t)→∞,t h en u m e r a t o r
goes to zero (because d1→∞), and the denominator goes to inﬁnity. Both
limits have the same eﬀect on Γ, pushing it to zero. Similarly, if ( T−t)>0,
then as S(t)→0,d2
1→∞ so the numerator goes to zero again. However,
having Sin the denominator pushes Γ in the opposite direction as S→0.
The exponentiation of d2
1in the numerator is much more powerful than the
linearity of Sin the denominator, so the ratio, Γ, is forced to zero as S→0.
If the option is exactly at-the-money [i.e., S(t)=X], then as maturity ap-
proaches, you have a knife-edge singularity. You get d1→0, so the numerator
of Γ goes to 1.H o w e v e r ,t h ed e n o m i n a t o rt e n d st oz e r o ,s ot h er a t i o ,Γ ,b l o w s

Inﬁnite gamma means the sensitivity of delta to small changes in price of the
underlying is inﬁnite. This means that the delta can jump from one-half up to
one, or down to zero with just a hair’s breadth move in the stock price. In this
knife-edge scenario, any delta-hedge that you establish is extremely sensitive
to a move in the underlying—you are not hedged.
If you try gamma-hedging (adding traded options to your delta-hedge to repli-
cate the convexity of the derivative), you will need many traded options in your
hedge portfolio, and it may become diﬃcult to manage the position.3Your

might need only 10 three-month calls to replicate the convexity of a standard call with one day to

©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 202 All Rights Reserved Worldwideproblems are similar (but much worse) if hedging barrier options (i.e., “knock-
outs”) as the price of the underlying approaches the knock-out barrier. The
problem is worse near a knock-out’s barrier than near a standard call’s kink.
This is because the knock-out’s delta can jump from one to zero whereas the
standard call’s delta jumps only from one-half to zero, or one-half to one.
For most American-style options (and for the more complicated Europeans),
there is no closed-form formulae. You will probably have to calculate Γ using
numerical techniques.
Answer 2.3: The key here is the shape of the risk-neutral distribution of ﬁnal
stock price, S(T), conditional on current stock price, S(t). Many people mis-
takenly assume the distribution of ﬁnal stock price to be both symmetric and
normal. The distribution is in fact lognormal.
The lognormal distribution is “right skewed,” which is also known as “posi-
tively skewed. ” It looks as though its top has been shoved from the right while
keeping its base ﬁxed. So, it has a right tail.
If we start with S(t)=X,a n d r=0 ,t h e nt h es k e w n e s si nt h ed i s t r i b u t i o n

strike than above it.4The call has bigger potential payoﬀs than the put
but (because of skewness) lower probabilities of achieving them. The put
has smaller potential payoﬀs than the call but (because of skewness) higher
probabilities of achieving them. The bigger payoﬀs and lower probabilities for
the call exactly match the smaller payoﬀs and higher probabilities for the put.
It follows that the put and call have the same risk-neutral expected payoﬀ and,
therefore, have the same value. It is straightforward to conﬁrm this equality
of values using put-call parity.
Answer 2.4: This is a common question. Stock price, S(t), ranges from $0 to
$∞; the “delta” varies from 0 to +1. When S(t) is very low (well out-of-the-
money), delta is close to zero; when S(t) is very high (well in-the-money), delta
is close to one; when S(t)=X(at-the-money), delta is very slightly higher
than one-half (assuming no dividends). The curve is smooth and looks very
much like a cdf (cumulative distribution function). This is not surprising, given
that delta = N(d1)=N(d1(S)), and N(·)i sac d f ,a n d d1(S) is an increasing

How about the intuition? The delta is how many units of stock you need to
hold to hedge a short call option. If your call option is deep in-the-money, you
need one unit of stock because the option will be exercised and the stock will
be called; if your option is deep out-of-the-money, you need no stock because
the option will expire worthless and the stock will not be called; if your option

Answer 2.7: Almost every person I have asked has got the answer to this one
backwards at ﬁrst. This is unfortunate, because it is a commonly asked ques-
tion. Think it through carefully before answering, and do not get caught out.
The delta is the number of units of stock in the replicating portfolio. Other
things being equal, the delta falls with a fall in stock price. However, you are
long the call and short the replicating portfolio. This means that the number

that his original formula has an obvious typo in it (he omits the dependence of d1andd2onρ).

and buy back some stock.
If you got it wrong, think about it as follows. Ask yourself how the replicating
portfolio changes (e.g., delta falls, so less stock is needed in the replicating
portfolio). Then ask yourself whether you are long or short the replicating
portfolio (you are short here). If you are short, be sure to reverse the impli-
cations (less stock shorted means you must borrow to buy some back).
Answer 2.8: With the standard European call, you have a simple closed-form
expression for the option’s delta. For example, (under the Black and Scholes
[1973] assumptions) the delta of a standard European call on a non-dividend-
paying asset is equal to N(d1)w h e r e

See Answer 2.6 for the delta in the case where there are continuous dividends
at rate ρ.
Unfortunately, only a few known options have closed-form pricing formulae.
For exotic options with no closed-form pricing formula, you need a pricing
algorithm. This may be a Monte-Carlo simulation,6a binomial tree, a nu-
merical PDE solution routine, or perhaps an ODE approximation to a PDE.
By varying the input value of the current level of underlying, you can use the
pricing algorithm to calculate a numerical derivative of price with respect to
level of underlying; i.e., the delta. All you are doing is using the computer
rather than the calculus to tell you how the option price changes with a change
in stock price.
Answer 2.9: The pricing formula for the standard Black-Scholes European call
option on a non-dividend-paying stock is:
c(t)=S(t)N(d1)−e−r(T−t)XN(d2),
where d1and d2are as previously deﬁned. N(d1)i st h eo p t i o n ’ s“ d e l t a , ”
sometimes denoted “∆. ” ∆ = N(d1)i st h es a m et h i n ga st h ep a r t i a ld e r i v a t i v e
6As an introduction to exotic options and Monte-Carlo techniques, I recommend the Monte-Carlo
chapter of my book Basic Black-Scholes (Crack [2021]). The earliest Monte-Carlo reference I know
of in option pricing is Boyle (1977). Boyle also gives techniques for accelerating the convergence of
Monte-Carlo estimation and some references to the mathematics literature (see Hull [1997, pp. 365–
368] for other techniques). For background information on the development of exotics and the
players in the market, see Fraser (1993); for a slightly higher-level than Hunter and Stowe (1992),
see Ritchken, Sankarasubramanian, and Vijh (1993) or Hull (1997); at a slightly higher level still,
see Goldman, Sosin, and Gatto (1979) or Conze and Viswanathan (1991). Note that the value of a
look-back option to buy at the minimum or sell at the maximum might arguably be considered an
upper bound on the value of market timing skills—see Goldman, Sosin, and Shepp (1979) for more
details.

of call price with respect to underlying:∂c(t)
∂S(t). It measures how the call price
changes per unit change in the price of the underlying.
Another interpretation of the terms involves a replicating portfolio. ∆ =
N(d1)i st h en u m b e ro fu n i t so fs t o c ky o um u s th o l di nac o n t i n u o u s l yr e b a l -
anced portfolio that replicates the payoﬀ to the call. The term e−r(T−t)XN(d2)
is the value of the borrowing (or a short position in bonds) required in a con-
tinuously rebalanced portfolio that replicates the payoﬀ to the call. The value
of the borrowing in the replicating portfolio is always less than or equal to the
value of the replicating portfolio’s long position in the stock. This is equivalent
to stating that the call has non-negative value.
Another interpretation of the terms involves expected beneﬁts and expected
costs to owning the call. The term S(t)N(d1)i st h ed i s c o u n t e dv a l u eo ft h e
expected beneﬁt of owning the option (expectations taken under a risk-neutral
probability measure). Why is the N(d1)t h e r e ? W e l l , N(·)i sac u m u l a t i v e
distribution function, so it must be that N(d1)≤1. This in turn implies that
S(t)N(d1)≤S(t). This is because the future beneﬁt of owning the option is
S(T)i ft h eo p t i o nﬁ n i s h e si n - t h e - m o n e ya n dz e r oi fi tﬁ n i s h e so u t - o f - t h e - m o n e y
(or “under water”). This beneﬁt is strictly dominated by a long position in
the stock (a position that returns S(T)r e g a r d l e s so fw h e t h e rt h eo p t i o ni si n -
or out-of-the-money and costs S(t)n o w ) .I tf o l l o w st h a ty o uv a l u et h eb e n e ﬁ t
from the call at less than the long position in the stock, S(t)N(d1)≤S(t). It
is for this reason that the N(d1) term multiplies the S(t)t e r m .7
The term e−r(T−t)XN(d2) is the discounted value of the expected cost of
owning the option (with expectations taken under a risk-neutral probability
measure). You can see all the components of the discounted expected value
as follows: N(d2)i st h e( r i s k - n e u t r a l )p r o b a b i l i t yt h a tt h ec a l lo p t i o nﬁ n i s h e s

the put option ﬁnishes in-the-money (i.e., the call ﬁnishes out-of-the-money),
Xis your payoﬀ if it does, and e−r(T−t)is the discounting factor.
The present value of the cost of owning the put option is S(t)[1−N(d1)].
There are two probabilistic interpretations of N(d1), each under a competing
martingale measure (see Crack [2021]).
Using the property that [1 −N(z)] =N(−z), the value of the put option must
be
p(t)=e−r(T−t)XN(−d2)−S(t)N(−d1),
where d1andd2are as already deﬁned for the call.
Put-call parity says that

See Crack (2021, Chapter 8) for extensive discussion of Black-Scholes inter-
pretations and intuition.8
Answer 2.10: Questions about a “digital option” or “binary option” are quite
common. The digital “cash-or-nothing” option that pays HifS(T)>Xhas a
value of He−r(T−t)N(d2). This is simply the discounted (risk-neutral) expected
payoﬀ to the option: N(d2)i st h e( r i s k - n e u t r a l )p r o b a b i l i t yt h a tt h eo p t i o n
ﬁnishes in-the-money; His the payoﬀ if it does; and e−r(T−t)is the discounting
factor. His sometimes called the “bet. ” If His chosen to equal the strike of
the standard Black-Scholes option, then the cash-or-nothing option has the
same value as the second term in the Black-Scholes formula: e−r(T−t)XN(d2).
The ﬁrst term in the Black-Scholes formula, S(t)N(d1), is the value of a long
position in a digital “asset-or-nothing” option. A long position in the asset-or-
nothing option, combined with a short position in the cash-or-nothing option,
replicates the payoﬀ to the European call—and, therefore, has the same value
(you should draw the payoﬀ diagrams to verify this).9
Be sure to see Question 2.11 and Answer 2.11 for more details on the binary
option.
Answer 2.11: I look at this intuitively ﬁrst and then more rigorously. Intuitively,
if the digital “cash-or-nothing” option is deep in-the-money, you are just wait-
ing for your ﬁxed cash payoﬀ, and increases in volatility can only decrease
8Note that there is a competing stock-numeraire world where if the bond de-trended by the
stock follows a martingale, then N(d1)i nt h eB l a c k - S c h o l e sf o r m u l ai st h ep r o b a b i l i t yt h a tt h ec a l l
ﬁnishes in the money (see Crack [2021] for details). It is a Z-score argument similar to the one
that establishes N(d2) as the probability that the call ﬁnishes in the money in a world in which the
stock de-trended by the bond follows a martingale.
9As an aside, you might like to note that the payoﬀ to the European call may also be replicated
by using barrier options: you need a “knock-out” call option plus a “knock-in” call option.

Figure B.2 (on p. 209) shows∂CALL PRICE
∂σ2 for the asset-or-nothing digital op-
tion, the cash-or-nothing digital option, and the standard call (all options are
European). The price of the standard call is just the diﬀerence between the
prices of the asset-or-nothing digital option and the cash-or-nothing digital
option. Diﬀerentiation is a linear operation, so the sensitivity of the standard
call to volatility is just the diﬀerence between the sensitivity of the asset-or-
nothing digital option and the cash-or-nothing digital option.
It is clear from Figure B.2 that the price of the standard call is increasing in
volatility. This should come as no surprise. A call option is an insurance policy.
It puts a ﬂoor on your losses. When there is more risk about, the premium
(i.e., call price) should be higher. In the same way, you should be happy to
pay more for ﬁre insurance if you ﬁnd out that your next-door neighbor is an
arsonist. See Chance (1994) for more details on the sensitivity of option value
to the various input parameters.
For the cash-or-nothing, the boundary on the sign of∂c(t)
∂σ2is always slightly
less than X(see Figure B.2 for a clear illustration). Thus, if you are in-the-
money, or at-the-money, more volatility is always bad; if you are very slightly
out-of-the-money, more volatility is still bad [when Xe−(r+σ2
2)(T−t)<S(t)≤
X]; if you are well out-of-the-money, more volatility is always good [when
S(t)<X e−(r+σ2

for which∂c(t)
∂σ2is always non-negative (see Figure B.2).

out the distribution of S(T), putting more probability weight into the tails;
second, increasing σ2drags down the median of the distribution,11tending
to pull probability weight leftward and out of the right tail, thus increasing
the skewness. If the strike price is at or below the median of S(T)( s ot h e
option is in-the-money, or very slightly out-of-the-money), then both forces
push probability mass leftward, increasing the likelihood of ﬁnishing out-of-
the-money. However, if the strike price is far above the median of S(T)( s ot h e
option is far out-of-the-money), then the increasing spread of the distribution

option must be struck above the median of the distribution of S(T). The strike
price that just balances the inﬂuence of both forces is X=S(t)e(r+σ2

At this strike, the option is insensitive to instantaneous changes in σ2and it
is slightly out-of-the-money: S(t)=Xe−(r+σ2

Answer 2.12: The naive and time-consuming way to ﬁnd the delta for the knock-
out option (or “barrier option”) is to diﬀerentiate the closed-form pricing for-
mula for the down-and-out, ﬁnd∂C
∂S,a n dc o m p a r ei tt ot h es a m eq u a n t i t yf o r
the standard call.12It is more elegant to use common sense and some limiting
relationships to deduce the relationships between the deltas of the knock-outs
and the standard call.
The delta is the sensitivity of call price to underlying. This means that the
option’s delta is just the slope when you plot call value, c(t), against underlying
value, S(t). Do not get this plot mixed up with the payoﬀ diagram (the one
with a “kink” for a standard call). See Figure B.1 (on p. 202).
Now, everything you can do with a down-and-out option, you can also do
with a standard option. On top of that, you still have a standard option in
your hands in cases where the down-and-out gets “knocked out.” It follows
that the standard call is more versatile than the down-and-out call and must
be more expensive. Thus, the value of the standard call must plot above the
value of the down-and-out call for any value of the underlying. However, the
two calls have the same value for very large S(t)—because the down-and-out
option is unlikely to get knocked out. Both valuation curves are smooth, so
the down-and-out call’s valuation curve must be steeper [it starts lower than
the standard call and “ﬁnishes” in the same place for high S(t)]. A steeper
valuation curve when plotted against the level of underlying means precisely
that the delta is higher for the down-and-out call than for the standard call.
11The mean of the risk-neutral distribution of S(T)c o n d i t i o n a lo n S(t)i sS(t)er(T−t);t h em e d i a n
isS(t)e(r−1
2σ2)(T−t).
12The closed-form valuation formula for the down-and-out, together with discussion, is in Merton
([1973, pp. 175–76]; [1992, p. 302]). It takes around 15 minutes to diﬀerentiate it by hand carefully
and about the same time to program the numerical derivative in MATLAB. The down-and-out
option was introduced by Gerard Snyder (1969). See his paper for a look at the operations of the
options markets in the late 1960s.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 210 All Rights Reserved WorldwideFor the up-and-out, you get a diﬀerent answer. As before, the up-and-out
is a knock-out option and is cheaper than the standard call. However, the
standard call option and the up-and-out call option have the same value for
very small S(t)—because the up-and-out option is unlikely to get knocked
out. Both valuation curves are smooth, so the up-and-out call’s valuation
curve must be ﬂatter (it starts in the same place as the standard call and
ﬁnishes lower). A ﬂatter valuation curve means precisely that the delta is
lower for the up-and-out call than for the standard call.
Thus, the following relationships hold for the deltas of the diﬀerent options:
∆up−and−out call ≤∆standard call ≤∆down −and−out call
To hedge a short position in a down-and-out call, you need to buy more units
of stock than you do to hedge a short position in a standard call. The value
of the down-and-out call is more sensitive than the standard call to changes
in the value of the underlying stock.
Note that increasing the term to maturity or increasing the knock-out price
both increase the likelihood that a down-and-out call will be knocked out.
This makes the down-and-out call even cheaper relative to the standard call.
In fact, if the down-and-out call is very likely to be knocked out, the plot of
down-and-out call price against stock price can become concave. Conversely,
if the term to maturity is very short and the knock-out price is very low,
the standard call and the down-and-out call have virtually identical prices
(because the knock-out is very unlikely to be knocked out).
Answer 2.13: Your observation is that the sample variances are not linear in
time and that the diﬀerences are statistically signiﬁcant. This is equivalent to
rejecting the null hypothesis of a random walk using a “variance ratio” test (Lo
and MacKinlay [1988]).13This is contrary to the random walk assumptions
of the Black-Scholes model.
The observations are consistent with the empirical ﬁndings that some ﬁnancial
stock indices are positively autocorrelated at weekly return intervals (Lo and
MacKinlay [1988]).14This predictability inﬂuences the theoretical value and
the empirical estimate of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient σ(Lo and Wang [1995]).
An adjustment can be made to the Black-Scholes formula to account for the
predictability that is not part of the original Black-Scholes model. A new
diﬀusion process that captures the predictability can be deﬁned (Lo and Wang
[1995]).
With the new speciﬁcation, the autocorrelation is described using a more
complicated drift in the diﬀusion. The drift is now important for pricing the
13See also Peterson et al. (1992) for related variance ratio testing in the commodities market;
their ﬁndings lead them to a brief discussion of option pricing in the presence of autocorrelation.
14Autocorrelation in a time series is correlation between observations and themselves lagged. It
is also known as “serial correlation. ” Its presence neither implies, nor is implied by, the presence of
ad r i f t( C r a c k ,2 0 2 0 b ) .
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 211 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAPPENDIX B. DERIVATIVES ANSWERS
option. In the old speciﬁcation, drift was not important (Black and Scholes
[1973]; Merton [1973]).
The ﬁnal pricing formula takes the same form as the original Black and Scholes
(1973) formula. However, the way in which the volatility term σis estimated
changes. An increase in autocorrelation may either increase or decrease the
value of σ—it depends upon the speciﬁcation of the drift (Lo and Wang [1995,
p. 105]).
The presence of autocorrelation in stock returns is only one example of a real
world divergence from the Black and Scholes (1973) assumptions. For example,
Thorp (1973) discusses the eﬀect of restrictions on short sales proceeds. See
Hammer (1989) for a discussion of other deviations.
Answer 2.14: With no dividends, it is never optimal to exercise the plain vanilla
American call option prior to maturity because the option is worth more
“alive” than “dead. ” If you never exercise early, then the “American” fea-
ture of the call is not valuable. Thus, the standard American call option and
European call option (on a non-dividend-paying stock) have equal values. See
Crack (2021) for extensive discussion.
Figure B.3 plots the time value of the call option, c(t)−max[ S(t)−X,0],

absence of dividends.
The time value (the height in Figure B.3) tends to zero as expiration ap-
proaches, and this is regardless of stock price. The existence of positive time
value (i.e., value over and above exercise value) means that there is value in
waiting to exercise. It is this value that makes the American call more valuable
alive than dead. However, this does not mean that you should continue to hold
the option. Rather, it means that if you wish to exit the call position, you
should sell it, not exercise it. The time value is easily seen by looking at the
excess of option price over intrinsic value in the “Listed Options Quotations”
(i.e., options on individual stocks) in the Wal l Street Journal or online.
How does time value arise? There are costs to exercising a call prior to matu-
rity: you lose the interest you would have earned on the strike price and you
lose the ability to exercise later. These costs are both intimately linked with
the time to maturity, and thus they decline to zero as maturity approaches.
There is a beneﬁt to early exercise of a call: you capture any dividend pay-
ment on the underlying. In the presence of dividends, you gain the beneﬁts
with least cost by waiting until just prior to the ex-dividend day to exercise.
In this case, you would exercise only if the beneﬁt outweighs the costs. In
practice, these costs of early exercise typically outweigh the beneﬁt until the
last ex-dividend date during the life of the option (Cox and Rubinstein [1985,
p. 144]). By this time the costs of early exercise have depreciated substantially.

Answer 2.15: The naive answer is that as stock price falls, so too does the delta.
However, this ignores the inﬂuence of the passage of time on your hedge. This
is a good question, because you must think in both dimensions.
Two opposing forces are at work here: First, other things being equal, the
delta of a call option that is in-the-money rises toward +1 as the option gets
closer to expiration;15second, other things being equal, as stock price falls,
the delta of a call option falls.
If stock price is observed to fall gently over the ﬁnal two months, and the
option remains in-the-money, the approach of the expiration date pushes the
delta up to +1. If the fall in stock price is a little stronger, you may see the
delta fall somewhat initially (and you will sell stock in your hedge portfolio).
However, if the option ﬁnishes in-the-money, then the delta rises to +1 at the
end of the life of the option (and you will buy stock in your hedge portfolio).
Answer 2.16: Introductory courses typically do not say much about jump pro-
cesses.
The Black and Scholes (1973) model naively assumes that stock prices are
continuous. That is, they assume that you can draw the price history without
lifting your pencil from the paper. You need only stand on the ﬂoor of an
exchange,16watch a real-time feed (e.g., on a Bloomberg terminal), or read
the WSJ headlines after an “event” to see that prices do not move smoothly.
Indeed, the fact that stock prices are typically quoted with a minimum tick
size (either exchange-imposed or eﬀective) means that stock prices cannot
move continuously. You can think of big stock price jumps as being stock
price responses to the arrival of information in the market; small stock price
jumps might just be due to the random ebb and ﬂow of non-information-based
(i.e., liquidity-related) transactions.
A “jump” price process is a price process that has infrequent jumps (i.e., dis-
continuities) in it. If the jump process is a very simple one, the Black-
Scholes/Merton no-arbitrage technique can still be used to hedge and price
options on an asset whose price follows the process. If the jump process is
more complicated, the no-arbitrage technique breaks down. See the following

called away. Of course, if the option is out-of-the-money, the approach of the expiration pushes the
delta down to zero. If the option is at-the-money, then (assuming a non-dividend-paying stock) the
delta tends to a number slightly greater than one-half as the expiration date approaches (Cox and
Rubinstein [1985, ﬁgure 5-13, p. 223]).
16I have been on the ﬂoors of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Chicago Board of Trade
(CBOT), Boston Stock Exchange (BSE), and Dunedin Stock Exchange—long since replaced by
screen trading—during trading hours. I have also visited the Chicago Board Options Exchange
(CBOE), Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), Chicago Stock Exchange (CSE), and the old Paris
Bourse. The ﬁnancial futures ﬂoor at the CBOT was big enough to ﬁt a 747 jumbo jet with
space to spare—and noisy as hell. Conversely, the BSE is small and quieter than your typical MBA
computer lab. I forecast that all the Chicago futures exchange ﬂoors will soon be deserted—replaced
by electronic trading. The NYSE may take a little longer, but I think it will suﬀer the same fate.

In this simple example, if Jis ﬁxed (i.e., non-random), a riskless hedge portfo-
liocanbe formed, and options on an asset whose price follows this simple jump
process canbe valued using the Black-Scholes/Merton no-arbitrage technique.
This should come as no big surprise. The only real diﬀerence between this
“pure Poisson process” case, and the simple binomial option pricing situation
(Sharpe [1978]; Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein [1979]; Rendleman and Bartter
[1979]; Cox and Rubinstein [1985]; Crack [2021]) is that the arrival time of the
jump up or jump down is a random variable. You do not need to know when
the stock price will jump to hedge the risk in a binomial setting. This “pure
Poisson process” is a special case of a more general jump diﬀusion process
discussed next.
Consider the jump diﬀusion processdS
S=(α−λk)dt+σdZ+dq(described in
detail in my Footnote 8 to Question 2.16 on p. 67). When σ=0a n d Y≡dq+1
is non-random, you get Cox and Ross’s simple jump process above, and the
no-arbitrage technique can be used to hedge and price options on the jump
process.18Otherwise, when σ>0a n dv a r ( Y)≥0 it is not possible to form a
riskless hedge portfolio or use the no-arbitrage technique (Cox and Ross [1976,
p. 147]; Cox and Rubinstein [1985, pp. 361–371]; Merton [1992, p. 316]). Both
the (non-jump) diﬀusion process and the (non-diﬀusion) simple jump process
are the continuous limits of discrete binomial models. However, the jump-
diﬀusion is not. It is for this reason that a riskless hedge cannot be formed in
the jump-diﬀusion case (Cox and Rubinstein [1985, pp. 361–371]).
The fundamental reason that the no-arbitrage technique can be used to hedge
and price options in the standard Black-Scholes world is linearity. In continu-
ous time, the Black-Scholes option price is an instantaneously linear function
of the stock price. Portfolio building is a linear operation, and it follows that
payoﬀs to the option can be perfectly replicated by building and continuously
rebalancing a portfolio of the stock and the bond. Linearity breaks down
when the jump term has positive variance—the call price becomes a nonlinear
function of the stock price and perfect hedging is not possible (Merton [1992,
17In this example, πis a continuous time “Poisson process. ” The term λis the “intensity” of the
process.
18I thank John Cox at MIT for explaining to me why such jump processes can be perfectly hedged

p. 316]).
Although the no-arbitrage technique fails to price the option on the jump
diﬀusion process, you can price the option using an equilibrium argument. An
instantaneous CAPM (capital asset pricing model) approach may be used—
as it was in the original Black and Scholes (1973) paper. The information
that causes jumps may be assumed to be ﬁrm-speciﬁc (i.e., unsystematic and
diversiﬁable).19You can hedge out the non-jump part of the option and deduce
that the remainder (the jump) must have zero beta and, therefore, a riskless
rate of return. This yields a partial diﬀerential equation that can be solved to
give the call option price as an inﬁnite summation:

discussion of the foregoing and Haug [2007, Section 6.9.1] for practical issues).
You cannot perfectly hedge the call when the underlying follows the general
jump diﬀusion [ σ> 0, var( Y)≥0]. However, you can hedge out the con-
tinuous parts of the stock and option price movements. This leaves a risky
hedge portfolio following a pure jump process (with stochastic jump size). If
you follow the Black-Scholes hedge when you are short the option, then most
of the time you earn more than the expected rate of return on the risky hedge
portfolio. However, if one of those occasional jumps occurs (i.e., news arrives),
you suﬀer a reasonably large loss. In the non-diversiﬁable jump case, the re-
turn to the hedge portfolio when there is a jump balances the return during
normal time to some extent, but not well enough to make the equilibrium
return on the hedge equal to the riskless rate; as mentioned above, the hedge
is risky.
In general, there is no way to adjust the parameters of the hedge technique

Finally, if the underlying asset price is modeled as a jump process, the standard

jump model vary with the distributional assumption for the size of the jump

Answer 2.17: Most people upon whom I have tested this one make several mis-
takes. Please note that at time tprior to maturity the call price function is
notasymptotic to the line with slope 1 rising from the strike price;21Merton
(1973) demonstrates the correct relationship, discussed below. So, if you made
this mistake, stop reading here and go back and try again.
The correct plots appear in Figure B.4. The parameters used are X=8 0 ,
r=0.05,T−t=1 ,a n d σ=0.20. The plot of call value against terminal
stock price is the classic “kinked” call option payoﬀ (the top plot in Figure B.4).
Call value (terminal payoﬀ) rises with slope 1 from the point S(T)=X.
The plot of call price versus futures price is a smooth curve that is asymptotic
to the line c=0w h e nt h ef u t u r e sp r i c e , F(t, T)=S(t)er(T−t),i sv e r ys m a l l ,
and asymptotic to a line rising with slope e−r(T−t)(i.e., slightly less than 1)
from the point F(t, T)=Xwhen the futures price is very large (the middle
plot in Figure B.4). One way to conﬁrm the slope of this line is to use the
chain rule:∂C
∂F=∂C
∂S·∂S
∂F,w h e r e∂C
∂Sis the delta (which goes to 1 when Fand
Sare large) and∂S
∂Fis just e−r(T−t).T h es l o p eo ft h el i n ei nt h i sm i d d l ep l o t
thus gets closer to one as maturity approaches, but it is strictly less than one
at any prior time.
The plot of call price versus stock price, S(t), is a smooth curve that is asymp-
totic to the line c= 0 when the stock price, S(t), is very small, and asymptotic
to the line that rises with slope 1 from the point S(t)=Xe−r(T−t)(which
equals $76.10 here) when the stock price is very large.22See the bottom
plot in Figure B.4. The last two results are tied together by the fact that
F(t, T)=X⇔S(t)=Xe−r(T−t).
At time tprior to maturity, the call price is lower if the futures price is equal
to $10 than it is if the stock price is equal to $10. This is because the futures
price represents expected future value in some sense, and this is not worth as
much as current value ($10 today is worth more than $10 tomorrow).
Answer 2.18: It should take only a few seconds to answer this fundamental ques-
tion. Black and Scholes (1973) assume an arithmetic Brownian motion in log
price. This assumption yields a geometric Brownian motion in price. The
volatility of continuously compounded stock returns, σ2, grows linearly with
holding period when stock prices follow a geometric Brownian motion. So, the
four-year σ2isfour times the one-year σ2.I t f o l l o w s t h a t t h e f o u r - y e a r σis

Answer 2.19: Suppose that the process S(t) is an arithmetic Brownian motion
of form
dS(t)=µdt+σAdw(t),
where µis the instantaneous drift per unit time, σAis the instantaneous
volatility of S(t), and w(t) is a standard Brownian motion (see Crack [2021]
for introductory discussion of Brownian motions). Under our assumptions, and
under the risk-neutral probability measure, the process is dS(t)=σAdw∗(t).
Assume a strike of X.N o t e t h a t u n d e r t h e r i s k - n e u t r a l p r o b a b i l i t y m e a s u r e

The call price is the discounted expected payoﬀ under the risk-neutral proba-
bility measure, as follows:
c(t)= e−r(T−t)E∗[max( S(T)−X,0)|S(t)]
=E∗[max( S(T)−X,0)|S(t)]
From Equation B.2, it follows that
S(T)= S(t)+σA(w∗(T)−w∗(t))
=S(t)+σAW∗,
where W∗≡w∗(T)−w∗(t) is normal N(0,T−t)u n d e rt h er i s k - n e u t r a lp r o b -

The arithmetic Brownian motion pricing formula (equation B.3, above) is
not well known. This is because an arithmetic Brownian motion is not a
reasonable assumption for a price process: arithmetic Brownian motions can
assume negative values. However, the geometric Brownian motion assumed by
Black and Scholes (1973) is always non-negative, just as a price process should
be. The importance of pricing options on stock catapulted the Black-Scholes
formula (and the geometric Brownian motion beneath it) to super-stardom,
while the pricing formula for the arithmetic Brownian motion languishes in
relative obscurity.
Let’s have a little history. Louis Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Bachelier ﬁnished
his mathematics PhD thesis at the Sorbonne in Paris in January 1900.23The
topic of his thesis was the pricing of options contracts traded on the Paris
Bourse.24Bachelier (1900) assumes that stock prices are normally distributed
and follow an arithmetic Brownian motion. He also assumes that expected
returns on stocks (and on investments in general) are zero. Bachelier was the
ﬁrst to publish payoﬀ diagrams for a European call option. Bachelier was
also the ﬁrst mathematician to use the “reﬂection principle. ”25Bachelier’s
derivation of the mathematical properties of Brownian motion predates by
ﬁve years Albert Einstein’s 1905 work on Brownian motion (Einstein [1905]).
Bachelier even tested the predictions of his model using actual option prices
on the Paris Bourse and found them not too far wrong.26
Unfortunately, Bachelier’s assumptions violate some basic economic principles.
In particular, he violates limited liability, time preference, and risk aversion
23The Sorbonne was the prestigious University of Paris founded by Robert de Sorbon in 1253.
The Sorbonne was split into 13 units during the period 1968–1970. Nowadays, the name “Sorbonne”
refers to the original university or to three of the 13 units that retain the title as part of their name.
I have had the pleasure of visiting the Sorbonne as a tourist twice. It is on the Left Bank, not far
from Notre Dame.
24A very brief look at Bachelier’s model is in Appendix A of Smith (1976); a full translation
appears in Cootner (1964). Note that my option pricing formula, Equation B.3, is mathematically
equivalent to equation A.5 in Smith (1976). On an historical point of some coincidence, note that
as I write this (for my ﬁrst edition in 1995) it is Louis Bachelier’s 125thbirthday. Bachelier was
born in Le Havre, France, on March 11th, 1870. See also Zimmerman and Hafner (2007) for a
discussion of the Bronzin option pricing work of 1908.
25It is also known as the method of “reﬂected images. ” If you do not yet know what the reﬂection
principle is, you probably do not need to know. If you are curious, see Harrison (1985, p. 7) for
details.
26Samuelson (1973, Footnote 2, p. 6) compares Bachelier (1900) and Einstein (1905). He declares
Bachelier dominant “in every element of the vector. ” See Samuelson (1973) for further discussion
(and criticism) of Bachelier and other topics in the mathematics of speculative prices.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 220 All Rights Reserved Worldwide(see Samuelson [1965, p. 13] for discussion). However, the signiﬁcant contri-
butions of Bachelier’s thesis mean that he is rightfully considered the “father
of modern option pricing theory” (Sullivan and Weithers [1991]).
In the special case when S(t)=X(the option is struck at-the-money), Equa-
tion B.3 reduces to27

tion of arithmetic Brownian motion. You might reasonably ask how does
Equation B.4 compare to Black-Scholes for an at-the-money call option when
r=0 ?
The Black-Scholes formula for pricing a standard European call on a non-
dividend-paying stock reduces to Equation B.5 in the special case when r=0

Compare Equation B.6 with Equation B.4. In the arithmetic Brownian motion
case, σAis the standard deviation of the level of the price process S(t); in the
geometric Brownian motion case, σis the standard deviation of continuously
compounded returns. Standard deviation of price is, however, approximately
equal to price times the standard deviation of continuously compounded re-
turns. It follows that the pricing in Equations B.4 and B.6 is consistent, even
though the ﬁrst uses an arithmetic Brownian motion (supposedly incorrect),
and the second uses a geometric Brownian motion. Thus, the Black-Scholes
formula reduces to the century-old Bachelier formula.

Answer 2.20: Black-Scholes in your head!? This technique is so well known that
some interviewers just ask if you can do it, and if you say yes they move on.
It’s not worth the gamble if you don’t know it.30

reduced formula) from Answer 2.19 as a rough but fundamental call pricing

where σis the standard deviation of returns or where σSis replaced by the
standard deviation of prices. You should also note that this versatile little
formula prices bothputs and calls. Why is this? Well, if interest rates are low,
and the option is struck at-the-money, then in the absence of dividends a call
and put have the same value—just use put-call parity.
Many times interviewees are asked to price an option in their head where
the interest rate is zero and the option is struck at-the-money. You should,
therefore, know that the option pricing formulae of both Black-Scholes and
Bachelier reduce to Equation B.10 and that it works for both for puts and
calls. I expect you to be able to evaluate Equation B.10 in your head in less
than 10 seconds if asked to in an interview. How can you do this so quickly?

it helps that they usually give you easy numbers. For example, if S=$ 1 0 0 ,
σ=0.40, and ( T−t)=0 .25, the formula gives $8 (0 .4×0.4×100×0.5)
whereas Black-Scholes proper gives $7.97—not bad at all! The approximation
is usually accurate to within a couple of percentage points.

with time to expiration.
You should remember that in the special case where r=0 ,a n dt h eo p t i o n
is struck at-the-money [so that S(t)=X], the Black-Scholes European call
option pricing formula may be approximated by the following (see discussion
in Answer 2.20):
c(t)=σA/r⎬dic⎬l⎜igg
T−t
2π,
where σAis not standard deviation of continuously compounded returns, but
standard deviation of price. From this approximation, you can see that if the
call is at-the-money, the call value increases at something like the square root
of the term to maturity (if you double term to maturity, value increases by
40% to 50%). You must be very comfortable with this approximation.
The above approximation is a good place to start. However, a full answer
recognizes that the response of call value to term to maturity depends heavily
upon whether the call is in-the-money, at-the-money, or out-of-the money.
Sensitivity to term to maturity decreases as you move into-the-money, down
to zero in the limit if you are very deep in-the-money. Sensitivity to term
to maturity increases as you move out-of-the-money. Doubling the term to
maturity can easily double, triple, or quadruple the value of the call if it
is well out-of-the-money. The eﬀect is greater the further out-of-the-money
the call is—this is why deep out-of-the-money options are sometimes called
“lottery tickets. ”
You can see this eﬀect clearly if you compare the prices of actively traded
equity options and LEAPS.31Go to the listed options quotations in the third
section of the Wal l Street Journal .C h o o s e a s t o c k f o r w h i c h b o t h e q u i t y o p -
tions and LEAPS are traded. Compare the prices of call options on your chosen
stock that have the same strike, but diﬀerent terms to maturity (e.g., three
months, six months, one year, and two years). If you do this comparison for
diﬀerent strike prices, you should see that an extension in term to maturity has
the most impact on call option prices when the options are out-of-the-money.
You should see that for call options that are deep out-of-the-money, doubling
the term to maturity can easily quadruple the value of the call option.
In simple terms, if you extend the term to maturity, the option has more
opportunities to ﬁnish in-the-money, the present value of the cost of exercising
decreases, and the call value increases. The increase in the call value depends
upon the initial likelihood that the call will ﬁnish in-the-money. This likelihood
31LEAPS are “Long-term Equity AnticiPation Securities. ” That is, LEAPS are long-term options.
LEAPS have terms to maturity of up to three years. The term to maturity of standard exchange-
traded equity options does not exceed eight months. LEAPS are not exotic options, but exchange-
traded standardized options contracts. Like standard equity options, all LEAPS are American-style
options. Unlike standard equity options, equity LEAPS all expire in January; index LEAPS all
expire in December or January.

is small if the option is well out-of-the-money. Thus an increase in term to
maturity produces a proportionately greater increase in the value of an option

life is already as good as it gets (the put has limited upside). You want to
exercise now and take the money. Extending the life of the option pushes the
expected beneﬁt further away and decreases the put’s value.

FIRST SOLUT ION
As a loose rule of thumb, the standard deviation of price per period ($10 here)
is a rough measure of the average possible upside move or downside move
in stock price over the next period. You have approximately half-a-chance
of ﬁnishing in-the-money, and half-a-chance of ﬁnishing out-of-the-money (or
“under water,” as it is sometimes called). The expected payoﬀ is, therefore,

distribution of ﬁnal stock price means that the expected payoﬀ is slightly less
than $5 (it is around $4).

where σAis not standard deviation of continuously compounded returns, but
standard deviation of price. With T−t=1 ,a n d1√

Note that this technique is more accurate than the ﬁrst, giving $4 instead of
$5.
Answer 2.23: The answer cannot be found exactly in the Black-Scholes frame-
work, but you can get a good estimate.33Increasing the implied volatility
32For a very helpful practitioner view on the interpretation of partial derivatives of call price with
respect to each option pricing parameter, see Chance (1994).
33Francis Longstaﬀ suggested to me that an important option pricing problem is the handling
of “event risk” (personal communication [September 25, 1998]). For example, how do you price a
14-day option on a stock whose CEO is scheduled to make an important announcement in seven
days. I think this question is a loose attempt at this issue.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 224 All Rights Reserved Worldwideσby 25% (from 0.20 to 0.25) on one day out of 100 in the option’s life is
the same (to a ﬁrst-order approximation) as increasing σ2by 50% on one day
out of 100 in the option’s life.34This averages out to something like increas-
ingσ2by 0.5% for every day remaining in the option’s life (i.e., multiplying
the average σ2by a factor 1.005).35Using the approximation (see p. 222)
c(t)≈σS(t)/r⎬dic⎬l⎜ig
T−t
2π, we see that multiplying σ2byMhas the same eﬀect on
c(t) as multiplying T−tbyM. This is because each of σ2and ( T−t)a p p e a r
in the option formula under a square root sign—either implicitly or explicitly.
It follows that multiplying σ2by a factor 1.005 is equivalent to increasing the
term to maturity by something like 0.5% (i.e., one-half of a day for a 100-day
option). That is, increasing σ2by 50% on one day is equivalent to increasing
the length of one day by 50%.
Either of the adjustments mentioned increases the value of an at-the-money
option by a factor of about√
M—a quarter of a percent here. Note that
the equivalence of the 50% increase in σ2on one day and the extension of
option life by half a day is a general result—because variance is linear in time.
However, the conclusion that either of these adjustments increases option value
by about a quarter of a percent applies only to at-the-money options. If an
option is deep in-the-money, the adjustments mentioned may have little or no
eﬀect on option value; if an option is deep out-of-the-money, the adjustments
mentioned may increase the option value by substantially more than a quarter
of a percent.

put with the same strike. If you hold the straddle until maturity, then you
need a price change of more than $5 either way in the underlying to proﬁt. A
smaller price change, however, can lead to proﬁts if it happens before maturity.
For example, using Black-Scholes (ignoring that CBOE equity options are
American-style), if σ=0.357, T−t=0.5,S=$ 2 5 ,a n d r=0.02, then a
straddle struck at $25 costs $5. If the price of the underlying suddenly jumps
to $27, then the straddle is suddenly worth $5.50 and you have an immediate
10% gain. See Table B.1 for details.
Answer 2.25: The Eurodollar futures contract is the most popular short-term
interest rate futures contract. The contract value used for marking-to-market
at the end of the day is $10 ,000×[100−90

rate. Between settlements, the market participants determine, through supply
and demand, what is considered a fair discount. At maturity, the discount δ
34The “implied volatility” is the volatility ﬁgure implicit within an option price, assuming that
market participants value options using the Black-Scholes formula. The “implied vol” appears ﬁrst
in the literature in Latan´ e and Rendleman (1976).
35As an aside, note this for the Black-Scholes formula: If we increase the calendar term to
maturity, but still call it “one period,” then we need to increase σ.H o w e v e r ,i fw ei n c r e a s e( T−t)

must converge to the three-month LIBOR U.S. dollar rate. Note that if the
discount is 5%, then δ=5.0i nt h ea b o v ec a l c u l a t i o n ,n o t0 . 0 5 .
The three-month LIBOR rate is typically about 40 to 50 bps (i.e., 0.40 to
0.50 percentage points) higher than the yield on three-month treasury bills
(this compensates for default risk of London banks).36The discount rate δis
thus highly correlated with U.S. interest rates. The contract value is highly
negatively correlated with δ, and thus highly negatively correlated with U.S.
interest rates.
Suppose that you are long a Eurodollar future. If U.S. interest rates rise, the
contract value declines, and you ﬁnance your loss at a relatively high rate.
If U.S. interest rates fall, then the contract value rises, but you invest the
marked-to-market gains at relatively low rates. If you hold the forward, rather
than the future, you do not have day-to-day gains and losses, so you are not
hurt in the same way by these opportunity costs. Other things being equal,
you would rather have the Eurodollar forward contract than the Eurodollar
futures contract. If the discounts are the same (as stated), then there is a
mis-pricing.37With the current mis-pricing, I would choose to go long the
Eurodollar forward and short the Eurodollar future.
Answer 2.26: It makes much more sense to simulate the underlying and ﬁnd the
36This is an estimate only. There is tremendous variation in the spread. The “Ted Spread” is
the Eurodollar futures less T-bill futures index point spread (with same delivery month). The Ted
Spread was a typical 45.9 bps on June 15, 2009. During the Global Credit Crisis, however, it spiked
up to over ten times this level—reaching 465 bps on October 10, 2008—as credit risk fears pushed
three-month USD LIBOR up to 4.82% and demand for safety pushed three-month T-bill yields
down to 24 bps.
37If the underlying were strongly positively correlated with U.S. interest rates, then the futures
contract would be more attractive than the forward. This is because daily gains can be invested at
relatively high rates, while daily losses are ﬁnanced at relatively low rates (see Hull [1997, pp. 55–56]
for more details).

is diﬃcult to model the call, because the instantaneous volatility of the call
changes whenever the leverage of the call changes (assuming the underlying
is of constant volatility). The leverage of the call changes whenever the stock
price moves (and it even changes if the stock price does not move—simply
because of time decay).
Answer 2.27: A quick review of “mortgage-backs” is in order. Mortgage-backed
securities are shares in portfolios of mortgages. The value of all U.S. mortgage-
backed securities outstanding was $9,880,600,000,000 ($9.8806 trillion) at the
end of Q2 2019, according to SIFMA’s web site. This compares with $8.7663
trillion ﬁve years earlier (Q2 2014), $8.390 trillion at the end of 2006, and
$2.606 trillion at the end of 1996. The Q2 2019 total is composed of agency
MBS (75%), agency CMO (11%), non-agency CMBS (6%), and non-agency
RMBS (8%), where the acronyms stand for mortgage-backed securities, col-
lateralized mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities, and
residential mortgage-backed securities.
Owners of mortgage-backs are exposed to “prepayment risk,” and “extension
risk. ” Prepayment risk is the risk that interest rates will fall, and borrowers
will exercise their right to reﬁnance at lower rates (they exercise their call
option on the mortgage). The problem is that the holders of the mortgage-
backs, therefore, get repaid when interest rates are low—the worst possible
time to receive the money. Conversely, extension risk is the risk that interest
rates will rise, and borrowers will slow down their rate of repayment—meaning
that holders of mortgage-backs get fewer dollars to invest at precisely the best
time for them to be investing. Mortgage-back investors thrive when interest
rate volatility is low.
The simplest mortgage-back is a “pass-through”—each share in the mortgage
pool provides a pro-rata share in the cash ﬂows to the pool, and thus each
share has identical risk and return characteristics.
Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO’s) are a type of mortgage-back that
splits the mortgage pool up into “tranches” (the French word for “slice”).
Unlike a pass-through, which gives equal shares to all holders, the tranches
are unequal shares. Take a simple example with only four tranches: “A,” “B,”
“C,” and “Z. ” The A, B, and C shares all receive regular coupons. The A
shares are retired (i.e., the principal is repaid) ahead of the other tranches
by using the earliest prepayments by borrowers. The B shares are retired,
through prepayments, only after the A shares are gone. The C shares are
retired, through further prepayments by borrowers, only after the A and B
shares are gone. The Z shares receive no payouts whatsoever until all of the
A, B, and C shares are gone. You may think of the Z shares as being like zero-
coupon bonds with a life equal to the life of the longest-lived mortgages in the
pool. CMO tranches thus provide diﬀerent risk-return proﬁles—in contrast to
pass-throughs.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 227 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAPPENDIX B. DERIVATIVES ANSWERS
With borrowers long a call on the mortgage (i.e., the right to buy back the
mortgage by prepayment), holders of mortgage-backs are short a share of each
of these calls from the mortgage pool. You will recall, of course, that long
calls have positive convexity and that short calls have negative convexity.
In the absence of the call feature of a mortgage-back (the fact that borrowers
have the right to prepay early), the mortgage back has positive convexity as a
function of interest rates—just like an ordinary non-callable bond (Sundaresan
[1997, p. 393]). However, when interest rates are low, the call feature becomes
important to borrowers. If interest rates fall, all borrowers will reﬁnance by
the time rates have fallen to some critical value. At this stage, the mortgage-
back is worth par. When interest rates are low, the importance of the call
feature (a short call position to the mortgage-back holder) means that the
mortgage-back can acquire negative convexity.38Negative convexity is also
called “compression to par” because of the convergence of the security’s value
to par as interest rates fall (Sundaresan [1997, p. 394]).
Note that although the mortgage-back value may have negative convexity, it is
still downward sloping as a function of interest rates. However, if interest rates
are low and close to the coupon rate of the mortgage back, then an increase in
volatility of interest rates can decrease the value of the security (Sundaresan
[1997, p. 394]). This result follows because the holder of the mortgage back is
short the calls that the borrowers are long—and calls increase in value with
volatility.
Now to the interview question. If you are long mortgage-backs, and you expect
a bond market rally, then you expect bond yields to fall and bond prices to
rise. Thus, your position will gain in value. The question is, which sign on
convexity would maximize the gain (+ or −)? Positive convexity provides a
steeper downward sloping plot of security value as a function of interest rates,
and this in turn implies a larger gain if rates fall—thus, you prefer positive
convexity.39
Af u l la n s w e rn o t e st h a tw eh a v ea s s u m e da parallel shift in the yield curve.
If the yield curve steepens or ﬂattens, the answer could change. Whether
additional convexity helps or hurts you depends upon the type of yield-curve
shift and the particular bonds under consideration. It needs to be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis. See the related discussion beginning on p. 278.
Answer 2.28: The hedging strategy is naive. This is called a “stop-loss strategy”
(Hull [1997, p. 310]). At ﬁrst glance, it replicates the payoﬀ to the call.
However, purchases and sales cannot be made at the strike price. When the
38In fact, this is a feature of any callable bond—if interest rates fall far enough, the call feature
kicks in and imparts negative convexity to the security.
39Convexity is not such an issue if you expect a bond market rout. When prices fall and rates rise,
prepayment becomes less attractive, and the call option in the hands of the borrowers assumes less
importance—and so does the negative convexity the call is able to impart to your mortgage-back
security value.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 228 All Rights Reserved Worldwidestock is near the strike, you cannot know whether it will cross over the strike
price or not. You have to wait until the stock price crosses the strike price.
This means you end up making purchases at a price slightly higher than the
strike and sales at a price slightly lower than the strike. The closer to the strike
you try to time your trades, the more frequently you can expect to have to
trade. You can get eaten alive by transactions costs (see Hull [1997, p. 310]).

in the process. The tests include verbal comprehension (mostly vocabulary
and word meaning), quantitative ability, spatial reasoning, logical reasoning,
mathematical ability, diagrams (odd one out, rotations, repeated patterns,

Answer 2.32: Most people incorrectly deduce that the derivative security is
worth $1. If you got this answer, go back right now and think some more. I
present three solution techniques: the ﬁrst uses standard no-arbitrage argu-
ments; the second uses partial diﬀerential equations (PDE’s); the third uses
stopping times.45
44The double factorial is deﬁned as n!! =/⎭r⎬celeft⎭igg

n·(n−2)!!,ifn≥2.
For example, 1!! = 1, 2!! = 2, 3!! = 3 ·1, 4!! = 4 ·2, 5!! = 5 ·3·1, and 6!! = 6 ·4·2.
45If you want a good introductory book on PDE’s, I recommend Farlow (1993). I loved this book
when I was a student. I still ﬁnd it a breath of fresh air compared to my other math books.

FIRST SOLUT ION
You are an investment banker. Assume there exists a derivative security that
promises one dollar when IBM hits $100 for the ﬁrst time. If this security is
marketable at more than $0.75, then you should issue 100 of them and use
$75 of the proceeds to buy one share of IBM. If IBM ever hits $100, sell the
stock and pay $1 to each security holder as contracted. You sell the securities,
perfectly hedge them, and still have money in your pocket. By no-arbitrage,
the security cannot sell for more than $0.75.
The converse is that if this security costs lessthan $0.75, you should buy 100
of these securities ﬁnanced by a short position in one IBM share. For this
to establish $0.75 as a lower bound on the security price (and, therefore, to
pinpoint the price at $0.75—the solution given to the interviewee by the Wall
Street ﬁrm), you need to assume that you can roll over a short position indef-
initely .T h i s a s s u m p t i o n s e e m s r e a s o n a b l e f o r m o d e r a t e a m o u n t s o f c a p i t a l .
However, it is not clear to me that this is a reasonable interpretation of “ignore
any short sale restrictions” when larger quantities of capital are involved. As
one colleague said to me: “If it were possible to short forever, I’d short stocks
with face value of a billion dollars, consume the billion, and roll over my short
position forever. ” This seems to be an arbitrage opportunity.
We conclude that $0.75 is a clear upper bound by no-arbitrage, and thus $1
cannot be the correct answer. Whether or not $0.75 is also a lower bound is
arguable (but it seems to make sense for moderate amounts of capital). The
second solution technique also establishes $0.75 as the value of the security.
SECOND SOLUT ION
This technique is more advanced and may be beyond the average candidate.46
The derivative value Vmust satisfy the Black-Scholes PDE (Wilmott et al.
[1993]):

The boundary conditions that make sense for V(S, t)a r e
V(S=1 0 0 ,anys>t)=$ 1 ,and
V(S=0,anys>t)=$ 0 .
Let us simplify our lives by searching initially for a solution that is aﬃne in
S:V(S, t)=kS(t)+l,f o rs o m ec o n s t a n t s kandl.47
The two boundary conditions imply that
(k×$100) + l=$ 1 ,and
(k×$0) + l=$ 0 .
46I thank Alan J. Marcus for suggesting this type of solution technique. I am responsible for any
errors.
47An aﬃne function involves both a linear portion, kS, and a constant, l.O nat w o - d i m e n s i o n a l

know how long to discount for. Let τbe the time at which S(t) ﬁrst hits B.

Answer 2.33: There are two ways to proceed: the ﬁrst way is to work out the
pricing formula from ﬁrst principles; the second way is to use Black-Scholes
option pricing as it stands, and attempt to obtain a similarity solution via
adjustments that account for the power payoﬀ.

follows that
∆power call ≈αS(α−1)em(T−t),for large S(t).
It follows that if S(t) is large, then as ( T−t)→0, we get that
∆power call ≈αS(α−1).
This should come as no surprise: If the power call is deep in-the-money, and
there is little time to maturity, then its sensitivity to changes in S(t)w i l l
be about the same as the sensitivity of Sα(t) to changes in S(t). The latter
sensitivity is just
∂Sα(t)
∂S(t)=αS(α−1).
One implication of this is that the delta of a power call continues to change
asS(t) increases.
What may come as a surprise is the shape of the power call option pricing
function (see Figure B.5). If α> 1, the plot of c(t)v e r s u s S(t)i ssteeper
than and above the plot of max( Sα−X,0) for large S(t) (it decays down
toward the payoﬀ as maturity approaches). If α<1, the plot of c(t)v e r s u s
S(t)i sl e s ss t e e pt h a na n d below the plot of max( Sα−X,0) for large S(t)
(it decays up toward the payoﬀ as maturity approaches). Only in the case

value as a function of stock price is less steep than and above the plot of
max( S−X,0). In all cases, the plot of c(t)a saf u n c t i o no f S(t)i sa b o v et h e
plot of max( Sα−X,0) for small S(t).
Mathematically, the approximation ∆ power call ≈αS(α−1)em(T−t)drives the
results for large S(t)( t o g e t h e rw i t ht h ef a c tt h a t mis positive if α>1a n d
negative if α< 1). Economically, the time value of the option drives the
results. When α>1, the power of Sis so high that the option value grows
more quickly with increasing Sthan does the intrinsic value. When α<1, the
option value grows less quickly than does the intrinsic value, and the European
nature of the option means that there is “negative time value” for having to
wait for such a low payout.
The payoﬀ diagram for the power call is a little strange because the “kink”
does not occur at S=X,b u ta t S=X1
α—see Figure B.5. For example, if
α=2 ,t h ep a y o ﬀd i a g r a mi sﬂ a tu n t i l S(T)=√

call will be higher than the delta of a standard call with strike X1
αbecause
the payoﬀ diagram is steeper. Conversely, if α<1, the delta of the power
call will be lower than the delta of a standard call with strike X1
αbecause the
payoﬀ diagram is less steep.

p. 119]). The reader should check that in the special case α=2 ,t h eg e n -
eral formula reduces to that previously given, and that in the special case
α= 1, the general formula reduces to standard Black-Scholes pricing.51
Answer 2.34: If the Black-Scholes assumptions are correct, then the implied
volatilities of options (those backed out of the Black-Scholes pricing formula
given the other pricing parameters) should fall on a horizontal line when plot-
ted against strike prices of the options used. However, the patterns that result
include smiles and skewed lines depending upon the underlying asset and the
time period (Hammer [1989]; Sullivan [1993]; Murphy [1994]; Derman and
Kani [1994]). Before the Crash of 1987, you typically got smiles when you
plotted the implied volatilities against strikes. Nowadays you are more likely
to get skews, or smirks.52
What is happening may be viewed in some diﬀerent and related ways. Option
prices are determined by supply and demand, not by theoretical formulae.
The traders who are determining the option prices are implicitly modifying
the Black-Scholes assumptions to account for volatility that changes both with
time and with stock price level. This is contrary to the Black and Scholes
(1973) assumption of constant volatility irrespective of stock price or time to
maturity. That is, traders assume σ=σ(S(t),t), whereas Black and Scholes
assume σis just a constant.53
If volatility is changing with both level of the underlying and time to matu-
rity, then the distribution of future stock price is no longer lognormal. The
distribution must be something diﬀerent. Black-Scholes option pricing takes
51Haug (2007, pp. 118–119) gives some of these formulae and cites Crack (1997, 2004).
52Another related deviation from Black-Scholes pricing is that implied volatilities when plotted
against term to maturity produce a “term-structure of volatility. ” That is, traders use diﬀerent
volatilities to value long-maturity and short-maturity options (Derman and Kani [1994, pp. 2–3];
Hull [1997, pp. 503–504]).
53Black (1976) is the earliest paper I know of that acknowledges that σ↑asS↓, and vice versa.

discounted expected payoﬀs relative to a lognormal distribution. As volatil-
ity changes through time, you are likely to get periods of little activity and
periods of intense activity. These periods produce peakedness and fat tails
respectively (together called “leptokurtosis”), in stock returns distributions.
Fat tails are likely to lead to some sort of smile eﬀect, because they increase
the chance of payoﬀs away-from-the-money.54
These irregularities have led to “stochastic volatility” models that account for
volatility changing as a function of both time and stock price level (Hull and
White [1987]; Scott[1987]; Wiggins [1987]; Heston [1993]; Hull [1997]). Appli-
cations to FOREX options include Chesney and Scott (1989) and Melino and
Turnbull (1990). The eﬀect of stochastic volatility on options values is similar
to the eﬀect of a jump component: both increase the probability that out-of-
the-money options will ﬁnish in-the-money and increase the probability that
in-the-money options will ﬁnish out-of-the-money (Wiggins [1987, pp. 360–
361]). Whether the smile is skewed left, skewed right, or symmetric in a
stochastic volatility model depends upon the sign of the correlation between
changes in volatility and changes in stock price (Hull [1997, Section 19.3]).
Answer 2.35: A local volatility model is a stochastic volatility model with the
additional condition that the volatility varies only with the level of the asset
price and with time, say, σt=σ(S(t),t). The stochastic volatility model is
assumed to produce option prices consistent with, or calibrated to, the prices
of traded options. For example, the underlying risk-neutral process might be
dS(t)=r(t)S(t)dt+σ(S(t),t)S(t)dw(t),
where w(t)i sas t a n d a r dB r o w n i a nm o t i o n ,a sa s s u m e db yD u p i r e( 1 9 9 4 ) . D e r -
man and Kani (1994a, 1994b) and Rubinstein (1994) are also local volatility
models, with local (or “move”) volatility inferred endogenously from a tree.
The volatility is “local” in the sense that it is driven only by the level of the
asset price and time, both visible at that point in the tree for example, rather
than being driven by an exogenous source of variability, like an additional
stochastic process.
Stochastic volatility models are not all local volatility models. For example,
the Heston (1993) model assumes that the stochastic volatility is driven by
its own stochastic process with its own Brownian motion. So, because the
volatility process depends upon more than just stock price and time, it is not
al o c a lv o l a t i l i t ym o d e l .
Rubinstein (1994, p. 809) points out that vega (i.e., sensitivity of option price
to volatility) no longer has a clear meaning in a model with stochastic local
volatility.
54The interaction of skewness and kurtosis of returns gives rise to many diﬀerent possible smile
eﬀects (Hull [1997, Section 19.3]; Krause [1998, pp. 145-148]).
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 244 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAnswer 2.36: This question is probably supposed to invoke misleading memories
of the barrier option parity relationship: Other things being equal, a down-
and-out call plus a down-and-in call is the same as a standard call. However,
ad o u b l e - b a r r i e rk n o c k - o u ti sn o tt h es a m ea sa nu p - a n d - o u tt o g e t h e rw i t ha
down-and-out. The latter pair of options is more valuable than the double-
barrier knock-out. The most obvious reason is that if the underlying moves
one way, then the double knock-out is knocked out, but a portfolio of a down-
and-out plus a down-and-in still contains one option. That is, the pair of
knock-outs is more versatile—and thus more valuable.
A double-barrier knock-out can be priced using lattice (e.g., binomial) meth-
ods. It may also be priced using the Kunitomo-Ikeda formula (Kunitomo and
Ikeda [1992]; Musiela and Rutkowski [1997, p. 211]; or the user-friendly Haug
[2007, p. 156]). The Kunitomo-Ikeda formula is an inﬁnite series. Typically,
only the leading few terms are needed for practical purposes (Kunitomo and
Ikeda [1992, p. 286]). More terms may be needed if volatility is high, term to
maturity is long, or the distance between the barriers is small (in each case
this increases the likelihood of knockout and the pricing is more diﬃcult).
Answer 2.37: The prices of the digital asset-or-nothing, da(t), and the digital
cash-or-nothing (with a “bet” size of $1) ,d c(t,$1), are just the two parts of

knocked in or knocked out (or both). Path-dependent options can typically
be priced using Monte-Carlo methods. However, Monte-Carlo does not work
for American-style options. Standard lattice techniques (e.g., binomial option
pricing) do not usually work for path-dependent options.55However, you can
price the “out-in” derivative using standard lattice methods, as follows. The
parity relationship for knock-outs says that a down-and-out plus a down-and-
in is a standard option. We can generalize this to conclude that an out-in
plus a double-barrier knock-out is the same as an up-and-out (other things
being equal). It follows that the out-in is worth the excess of the value of the
up-and-out over the double-barrier knock-out. Both these knock-outs can be
priced using standard lattice techniques.

Answer 2.40: Let us review quickly standard American options before looking
at the perpetual option. American options are harder to price than European
ones. Puts are harder to price than calls. An American put is hardest of all
to price because early exercise can in general be optimal at any time for an
American-style put. This diﬀers from an American-style call, for which early
55Standard lattice techniques can be modiﬁed to allow pricing of path-dependent options. How-
ever, a couple of conditions involving complexity of the payoﬀs need to be satisﬁed (Hull and White
[1993]; Hull [1997]).
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 246 All Rights Reserved Worldwideexercise is optimal only at a few dates during the option’s life (just prior to ex-
dividend days). In fact, the problem is so hard that no exact pricing formula
exists for standard American put options.
Black and Scholes (1973) value European-style puts and calls. If a stock does
not pay dividends, then a European call and an American call have the same
value (there is no incentive to exercise early). Thus, American calls on non-
dividend-paying stocks can be valued using Black-Scholes. The introduction
of dividends complicates matters. However, an approximate pricing formula
(Black [1975]) and an exact pricing formula (Roll [1977b]; Geske [1979]; Wha-
ley [1981]) for American calls on dividend-paying stocks are known (see Hull
[1997, Chapter 11]). American puts are more complicated. The dividend issue
is not as important for puts as for calls because it is the receipt of the strike,
not the dividends, that encourages early exercise of a put. Although no ex-
act American put pricing formula exists, there are approximations (Parkinson
[1977]; MacMillan [1986]; Barone-Adesi and Whaley [1987]). See the sum-
maries in Tables B.2 and B.3.
Now to the perpetual American put. Extending the life of an option in per-
petuity eases the pricing burden (removing the dependence on time turns a
PDE into an ODE). Pricing the perpetual American put was a question on
a problem set I had as a student in Robert C. Merton’s derivatives course at
Harvard in 1991. I reproduce my solution here.
LetVdenote the value of a perpetual American put option on a stock. Let S
denote the stock price. Let Xdenote the strike price. Assume that the stock
pays continuous dividends at rate ρ.L e t σandrdenote the volatility of stock
returns and the riskless interest rate respectively. The Black-Scholes PDE is
given by (Wilmott et al. [1993])
∂V
∂t+1
2σ2S2∂2V
∂S2+(r−ρ)S∂V
∂S−rV=0.
However, for a perpetual put, time decay must be zero (it cannot age if it
can live forever). Thus, the PDE becomes an ODE (though I am keeping the
partial derivative notation):
1
2σ2S2∂2V
∂S2+(r−ρ)S∂V
∂S−rV=0
LetSdenote the lower exercise boundary (this is how low the stock has to go
before exercise of the put becomes optimal—it has to be determined). Then,
we have the boundary conditions

Answer 2.41: If you subtract LIBOR, denoted “ L,” from both payments, it
seems that Party B is paying 24% −3×L. This is three times 8% −L.
The quoted swap is, therefore, equivalent to three swaps, each of which is a
swap of LIBOR for 8% ﬁxed (where Party A pays LIBOR, and Party B pays
8%).
Answer 2.42: If you sold the option, you should hold about one-half a share to
hedge. If you bought the option, you should short about one-half a share to
hedge. If you are at-the-money, there is about a ﬁfty-ﬁfty chance the option
ﬁnishes in-the-money; and with this expectation, you need about one-half a
share to hedge.
57Note that in the case of the perpetual American call, lim ρ→0λ1= 1, and lim λ1→1V(S)=S.
That is, with no dividends, the perpetual American call has the same value as the stock—just like
the perpetual European call.

Answer 2.43: Mean reversion is the tendency for a variable to return to some
sort of long-run mean. Interest rates are generally considered to be mean-
reverting: they go up, they go down, but they eventually return to some sort
of long-term average. In the case of a mean-reverting stock price, the stock
price would tend to be pulled back to the average if the price rises or falls very
far. This may reduce volatility and make the option cheaper.
A model of mean reversion makes sense for interest rates, and for stock returns,
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 250 All Rights Reserved Worldwidebut it is by no means clear to me that it makes sense for stock prices . Bates
argues that strong mean reversion in stock prices is implausible because of
speculative opportunities available from buying when S<¯Sand selling when
S>¯S(Bates [1995, pp. 7–8]). Lo and Wang say that autocorrelation in asset
returns can increase or decrease σ(and the option price) and that it depends
upon the speciﬁcation of the drift in the model (Lo and Wang [1995, p. 105]).
Mean reversion in prices can easily yield negative autocorrelation in both prices
and returns at some horizon. If we have autocorrelation in returns, then we
do not have a GBM, the Black-Scholes model is invalid, and the drift term in
the price process may be very important (Lo and Wang [1995]). Conversely,
if we have a GBM, then we have no autocorrelation in returns and the drift
term is unimportant for pricing options.58
At short horizons (e.g., daily or weekly), stock index returns used to be pos-
itively autocorrelated (Lo and MacKinlay [1988]) but this result has all but
disappeared now (Crack [2020b]). At longer horizons (e.g., three or four years),
Fama and French (1988) and Poterba and Summers (1988) say that stock re-
turns are negatively autocorrelated (i.e., mean reverting). However, evidence
for this is weak (Richardson [1993]). Lo and MacKinlay (1988, p. 61) say
that longer-term positive autocorrelation is not inconsistent with shorter-term
negative autocorrelation (i.e., mean reversion). Peterson et al. (1992) and
Lo and Wang (1995) discuss option pricing when asset returns are autocorre-
lated. Crack and Ledoit (2010) discuss hypothesis testing when asset returns
are autocorrelated.
Answer 2.44: Hedging can increase your risk if you are forced to both buy short-
dated options and hedge them. In this case, to hedge, you need to short the
stock. If the stock price rises up to the strike, and the options (be they puts or
calls) expire worthless, then you lose on both the options and the short stock
position. By hedging, you end up worse oﬀ than if you had not hedged.
Answer 2.45: This is a common question. You can hedge the written put by
shorting an asset whose returns are correlated with returns on the underlying
stock. Ideally, this would just be the stock itself. However, it is not always
possible to short stock. There are single-stock futures contracts on about 1,000
leading U.S. stocks (see www.OneChicago.com ), but that still leaves about
4,000 listed U.S. stocks and another 5,000 OTC stocks without single-stock
futures (Crack [2020b, 2021]). You could short index futures instead but that
would give you an imperfect hedge. You need to know either the beta or the
correlation of the stock returns relative to the index returns to apportion the
hedge correctly. You could also short the stock of a close competitor. If the
stock is heavily inﬂuenced by a commodity (e.g., gold, silver, oil, corn), you
could short commodity futures.
58Can you prove to your satisfaction that a GBM in prices implies very strong positive autocor-
relation in prices? See Crack (2020b, Chapter 1) for further discussion.

Answer 2.47: You want to be short a put if you expect the put to fall in price
(e.g., the underlying is expected to rise, volatility to expected to fall, etc.).
Answer 2.48: A fair price for future delivery of an asset depends upon the spot
price and the cost of carry. The cost of carry includes the cost of money
(i.e., an interest rate), dividend income, storage costs, and the convenience
yield. The only diﬀerence between the two pieces of land is the entrance fee
to the beach. This is a dividend that lowers the forward price of the beach

©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 252 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAnswer 2.50: The key is default risk, but let’s start with a quick swap curve
review. Swap rates are ﬁxed rates quoted by dealers against the ﬂoating leg
(e.g., six-month USD LIBOR) of an interest rate swap. The “swap buyer”
is the ﬁxed-rate payer and is said to be “long the swap” (although I have
also heard the reverse). The swap curve is inferred from quoted swap rates
for diﬀerent maturities in the same manner that a zero-coupon yield curve
(i.e., a “spot curve”) is bootstrapped from the yields on coupon bearing bonds
of diﬀerent maturities (corporates or treasuries). Swaps dealers can do cus-
tomized deals oﬀering diﬀerent quoted swap rates to companies of diﬀerent
credit rating; however, dealers tend to quote the same swap rate to companies
of diﬀerent credit rating but ask for diﬀerent amounts of collateral based on
the rating (personal communication with a NY dealer [April, 1999]).59The
collateral and subsequent margin calls essentially resolve the credit issues. Jo-
hannes and Sundaresan (2003, p. 9) state that the “key to eﬀective credit risk
mitigation is frequent margin calls. ” They state that more than 65% of plain
vanilla derivatives, and especially interest rate swaps, are collateralized and
that at least 74% mark to market at at least a daily frequency.
The settlement features of an interest rate swap mean that default risk in
a swap is higher than in a eurodollar futures contract but lower than in a
bond (Minton [1997, p. 253]). The reasoning is as follows. The settlement
rate for the futures contract is reset daily by market forces, but the swap
typically resets only every six months. Both the futures contract and the swap
are marked-to-market and use margins, but the futures contract is backed
by the triple-A-rated futures clearing corporation as a counterparty of last
resort and so the futures contract is less credit-risky than the swap. The swap
diﬀers from the bond because no principal changes hands.60At initiation, the
value of a swap contract is zero; but during the life of the swap, as interest
rates rise and fall, the value of the contract can become positive or negative,
respectively, to the swap buyer. Although a bondholder is always worried
about default risk, the swap buyer worries about default risk only when the
swap has positive value. Default on a swap is thus less likely than default
on a bond because default on a bond requires only that the company be in
ﬁnancial distress, whereas default on a swap requires both that the company
be in ﬁnancial distress and that the remaining value of the swap be positive.
The joint probability of both events needed for swap default is less than the
single probability needed for bond default (Minton [1997, p. 262–263, p. 267]).
It follows that the coupon rate on a bond will be higher than the quoted swap
rate for a swap of the same maturity. This is true for all maturities, so boot-
strapping the swap curve from swap rates of swaps of diﬀerent maturities and
bootstrapping the zero-coupon yield curve (i.e., the spot curve) from coupon
59Minton (1997, p. 252) conﬁrms that the plain vanilla swap quotes in her (1992 and earlier)
sample assume no credit enhancement (e.g., margins or marking to market).
60Although true for an interest rate swap, this is not so in a forex swap, where principal changes
hands at initiation and conclusion of the life of the swap.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 253 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAPPENDIX B. DERIVATIVES ANSWERS
rates of corporate bonds (e.g., AA-rated) of diﬀerent maturities produces a
swap curve strictly below the zero-coupon yield curve.61It follows that when
you discount the cash ﬂows to the bond using the swap curve, you get a num-
ber above that which you would get when you discount the cash ﬂows to the
bond using the zero-coupon yield curve (i.e., above par).
Answer 2.51: Try a simple economics argument. The option must cost the same
as a replicating portfolio—else there is money to be made. This result is
driven by no-arbitrage and is thus independent of risk preferences. I can ease
my calculations by assuming risk-neutrality for everyone in the economy. In
such an economy in equilibrium, the required return (and thus the expected
growth rate and also the discount rate) for all traded securities is the riskless
rate. I price the option as if we are in this economy (and the option pricing is
immune to this assumption).
Answer 2.52: Options live in the future, not the past: Today is the ﬁrst day of
the rest of the life of a traded option. Setting aside problems with volatility
smiles and skews, the implied volatility (or “implied standard deviation”) is a
market-consensus forecast of volatility over the remaining life of the option. It
would be logical, therefore, that implied volatility is a better predictor of future
volatility than is historical volatility. Indeed, this is found empirically for both
FOREX (Xu and Taylor [1995]) and for equity indices (Fleming [1998]).
Answer 2.53: Which is worth more, a European-style call that is 10% out-of-
the-money or a European-style put that is 10% out-of-the-money?62
The short answer is that the call is worth more because option value is dis-
counted expected payoﬀ relative to the distribution of possible payoﬀs, and the
call’s long right tail of possible high payoﬀs (and low probability of occurrence)
dominates the put’s stunted left tail of low payoﬀs (and high probability of
occurrence).
Let us assume that S=1 0 0 ,s ot h a tt h ec a l lh a ss t r i k e Xc=S×1.1=1 1 0 ,
and the put has strike Xp=S/1.1=9 0 .909090 ...(we could use Xp=9 0b u t
some of the exact relationships quoted below would then be approximations
only). Assume there are no dividends.
The distribution of stock prices at expiration is lognormal in the Black-Scholes
model and is thus positively skewed with its mean higher than the median,
61In early 1999, just before the Tech Bubble, two-year swap rates were about 40 bps higher than
U.S. treasuries (which were at 500 bps), about 5 bps lower than the yields on AAA-rated debt,
about 30 bps lower than the yields on AA-rated debt and about 40 bps lower than the yields on
BBB-rated debt. For comparison, ten years later in mid-2009, coming out of the Global Credit
Crisis, these rates/spreads were 45 bps, 120 bps, 3 bps, 75 bps, and 575 bps respectively. Five years
later still, in August 2014, these rates/spreads for a ﬁve-year maturity were 36 bps, 165 bps, 0 bps,
11 bps, and 68 bps, respectively.
62I thank Veeken Chaglassian for helpful advice on this answer; any errors are mine.

bution of future stock prices is Se(r−1

To make clear some subtle points, let us consider two special cases. First,
suppose that the interest rate satisﬁes r=1

and ( T−t)=1 ) ,t h e nt h em e d i a no ft h ed i s t r i b u t i o no f S(T) equals S(t)a t

that S(T)<X p.63That is, the call and put are exactly equally likely to ﬁnish
in the money (this exact result is only approximate if we use Xp=9 0 ) . F o r

put is worth about $9.56. That is, the call is worth more than twice what
the put is worth, even though the call and put have the same probability of
ending up in the money. This premium in the value of the call is driven by
the product of the upside payoﬀs (in the long right tail of the distribution of
S(T)), and their probability of occurring.
Second, suppose that the interest rate is zero, r=0 . T h e n ,u s i n gt h es a m e
numbers again, the risk-neutral probability that the call ﬁnishes in-the-money
is about 33.0%, and the risk-neutral probability that the put ﬁnishes in the
money is about 52.4%. Even though the put is much more likely to ﬁnish in-
the-money, the call is worth about $16.10 and the put is worth about $14.63
(the call is worth exactly 10% more that the put;64this exact result is only
approximate if we use Xp=9 0 ) .
My two special cases show that if we were to look only at the probability of
ﬁnishing in-the-money, we would be misled. It is the (discounted) product
of probabilities and payoﬀs that determine value, and in this case the right-
skewed distribution of ﬁnal stock price gives the call the higher price.

opposite signs. Not only that, but their magnitudes are going to be correlated.
For example, if Θ is large and negative then Γ is probably large and positive
(e.g., an at-the-money call close to maturity has these properties).
There are two exceptions amongst plain vanilla puts and calls. These were
mentioned on p. 200: Θ can be positive for a deep in-the-money European
call (if the dividend yield is high enough), and Θ can also be positive for a
deep in-the-money European put. As long as these options are not so deep
in-the-money that they have zero Γ, then they can have both positive Θ and
positive Γ.
Answer 2.55: If you said you have an 80% chance of getting $20, and a 20%
chance of getting nothing, giving an expected payoﬀ of $16, which you then
discount at zero to get an answer of $16 for the call value, you are wrong! Sure
enough, the call does have an expected payoﬀ of $16 in the real world, but the
discount rate is not zero. The discount rate is some leveraged version of the
discount rate on the stock, and you do not have that information. Try again,
then come back here for the answer below.
We do not know the discount rate on the stock. We do not know the discount
rate on the option. We must use risk-neutral valuation. The risk-neutral
probability π∗of an up move in the stock satisﬁes
S=e−r(∆t)[π∗Su+( 1 −π∗)Sd],
that is, $100 = π∗$130 + (1 −π∗)$70,
where ris the riskless rate (zero here), uis the multiplicative “up” growth
factor in the stock (1.30 here), and dis the multiplicative “down” growth factor
in the stock (0.70 here). See Crack (2021) or you favorite option pricing book
for deeper details of binomial/lattice pricing. Simple algebra yields π∗=0.50.
The value of the call is then
c=e−r(∆t)[π∗max(0 ,Su−X)+( 1 −π∗)m a x ( 0 ,Sd−X)]
=1 ·[0.50·($130 −$110) + 0 .50·($0)] = $10 .

However, the derivation is very instructive in risk-neutral pricing, PDE’s, and
similarity solutions, and I cannot ﬁnd it in my books so I think it belongs here.
One application of the product call is to the pricing of foreign equity options
struck in a domestic currency (Haug [2007, pp. 226–228]). For example, a U.S.
investor has the right to buy one share of NTT corporation stock (trading in
Tokyo at JPY price S2), but the call option strike price is in USD.65In this
case, the payoﬀ is max[ S1(T)×S2(T)−X,0], where S1is theUSD
JPYexchange
rate, S2is the JPY price of NTT per share, and Tis the expiration date.
Make the following deﬁnitions:
S1(t)=USD
JPY(t)
S2(t)=JPY
Share of NTT(t)
rUS=US riskless interest rate
rJP=Japanese riskless interest rate
q=NTT’s continuous dividend yield

r1=Drift of dS1/S1process
r2=Drift of dS2/S2process

X=USD-denominated strike price
So, what exactly are r1andr2in a risk-neutral world? The answer depends
upon whether we look from a U.S. or a Japanese perspective (Hull [1997,
p. 301]). We shall use the U.S. perspective. For S1from the U.S. perspective,
the risk-neutral process has r1=rUS−rJP.F o r S2from the Japanese perspec-

but we shall continue to work with r1,a n d r2,a n dt h e np l u gt h e s ei na tt h e
end. From our stochastic calculus training we know that as long as dynamic
replication is possible, then de-trended prices of traded assets are martingales
in the risk-neutral economy (Huang [1992]; Crack [2021, Section 4.4]). A
bullet-point review is called for before proceeding.
•R I S K − N E U T R A L P R I C I N G R E V I E W•
•The technical requirement for dynamic replication to be possible is described
nicely in Jarrow and Rudd (1983). Essentially, it requires that for very
small time horizons the value of the derivative and the value of the un-
derlying(s) be perfectly linearly correlated. A diﬀusion or a simple jump
process satisﬁes this, but if the underlying stock price follows a jump-
diﬀusion process (regardless of whether the jump size is deterministic,
stochastic, diversiﬁable, or non-diversiﬁable), then a replicating portfolio
cannot be formed, and the no-arbitrage pricing method fails (Cox and
Rubinstein [1985, chapter 7]; Merton [1992]).
•If dynamic replication is possible, then by no-arbitrage the value of the
derivative equals the start-up cost of a replicating portfolio.
•If the replication recipe is known (perhaps via an equilibrium CAPM pricing
approach as in the original Black and Scholes [1973] paper), then no two
economic agents can disagree on the correct arbitrage-free price of the
derivative. Thus, regardless of what we assume about the preferences of
the agents in the economy, the pricing of the derivative will be the same.
•We ease our calculations substantially by proceeding as if the agents in the
economy are risk-neutral.66That is, although they see the risk, they
ignore it completely.
•People in a risk-neutral economy care only about expected return. In equi-
librium all traded assets must oﬀer the same expected return (or investors
would still be shorting low-yield securities to invest in high-yield ones and
we would not yet be in equilibrium). Existence of a government-backed
ﬁxed-rate riskless asset means that the riskless rate is the equilibrium
required return on all securities in this hypothetical world.
66Important: We are not assuming anyone is really risk-neutral. It is simply that options prices
are immune to assumptions about risk preferences, and this proves to be a very helpful assumption.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 258 All Rights Reserved Worldwide•If risk is not priced by agents in the economy, then traded security prices
(including derivatives) are simply discounted expected payoﬀs where dis-
counting uses the riskless rate, and all traded security prices are assumed
to drift upwards at the riskless rate (less any dividend yield, of course—
so that total yield is the riskless rate). If risk were priced, then discount
rates would need to be risk adjusted, perhaps via the CAPM (Arnold,
Crack and Schwartz [2009, 2010]).
•LetB(t)≡ertdenote the price of a riskless money market instrument
(i.e., you invest $1 at time 0, and it grows at riskless rate r). Then B(t)
drifts upward at the riskless rate. The money market account serves as
a benchmark for performance in both the real and risk-neutral worlds.
It seems natural to express other asset prices in terms of units of this
asset.67That is, instead of looking at security price P(t), look atP(t)
B(t).
•With B(t) drifting upward at the riskless rate, and P(t) expected to drift
upward at the same rate in equilibrium in the risk-neutral world, it follows
thatP(t)
B(t)is expected to have no drift. That is, for any ∆ t>0,
E∗/⎭r⎬cketleft⎭iggP(t+∆t)

where E∗denotes expectation in the risk-neutral world.

That is, the best guess of where P†will be in the future (in the risk-
neutral world) is where it is today. This is akin to the eﬃcient markets
hypothesis. A random variable with this property is called a “martingale. ”
•When we assume that traded securities’ prices have required returns equal
to the riskless rate in the risk-neutral world, we are really just redis-
tributing the probabilities we associate with possible ﬁnal security price
outcomes.68However, some things stay the same. For example, if a stock
price outcome occurs with probability 0in the real world, then it still
occurs with probability 0in the risk-neutral world (thus, the range of pos-
sible outcomes does not change, only their probability of occurrence; and
the transformation of probabilities moves the expected return on IBM,
say, from 12% per annum to whatever the T-bill yield happens to be).
Similarly, if a stock price outcome occurs with probability 1in the real
world, then it still occurs with probability 1in the risk-neutral world.
67This is referred to as a change of “numeraire. ” A numeraire is a base unit of measurement. This
is similar to changing units of measurement from USD to GBP, say, except that here we choose a
USD-denominated money market account instead of GBP.
68Note the word “traded” here. A futures price, for example, is not the price of a traded asset,
so its drift need not be r.

•In probability theory, a mathematical function that allocates probability
weight to outcomes in the sample space is called a “measure. ” Two mea-
sures that reassign probabilities to outcomes without changing the range
of possible outcomes (as above) are called “equivalent measures. ”69
•Thus, in the risk-neutral world, we reallocate probabilities in an equiva-
lent manner (i.e., same range of possible outcomes), and the price of any
traded asset—when “de-trended” by the money market account—follows
a martingale. The probability measure (i.e., allocation of probabilities to
outcomes) in the risk-neutral world is thus called an “equivalent martin-
gale measure. ” You see this expression in the more advanced literature.
•Two natural derivative pricing methods fall out of all of the above. The ﬁrst
uses discounted expected payoﬀs, the second uses PDE’s.

The time- tvalue of the European-style product call expiring at time- Tis
simply its discounted expected payoﬀ in a risk-neutral world:
V(S1(t),S2(t),t)=e−rUS(T−t)E∗{max[ S1(t)S2(t)−X|Ωt]},
where E∗denotes expectation taken with respect to the risk-neutral probabil-
ity measure from the U.S. perspective, and Ω tis the time- tinformation set.
We could work this out directly (it would be a double integral with respect to
the two Brownian motions), but let us instead use the PDE approach.
Given the nature of the product call, I am going to guess that the solution is
a function of only two variables, not three: V(S1,S2,t)=κH(η,t)f o rs o m e

Advice: As an interviewer, I ﬁnd telephone interviews diﬃcult. Body lan-
guage and nuances of voice are lost. Be sure to use a landline not a mobile/cell
phone, hold the speaker close to your mouth, and speak a bit louder than
usual. If you insist on using a mobile/cell, make sure it is fully charged.
Answer 2.57: An Asian option is an average rate option. The underlying is a
time series average of prices. Changes in average prices are much less volatile
than changes in consecutive prices. Other things being equal, this lower volatil-
ity makes Asian options less expensive than plain vanilla options.
Answer 2.58: If the riskless rate is positive, and there are no dividends, early
exercise is not optimal for an American-style call, and the European and Amer-
ican call have the same value. If the riskless rate is zero, then there is no in-
centive for early exercise of an American-style put. In this case, the European
and American put have the same value.
Of course, that’s little consolation to you if you are short an American-style
option, a retail investor decides to exercise non-optimally, and you are as-
signed.
Answer 2.59: The one thing to watch out for here is that there are ( N+1) terms
in the summation in both cases.
In the case of a recombining tree the answer is 1+2+3+4+ ···+N+(N+1) =/summ⎬tiontextN+1
i=1i=(N+1)( N+2)
2(using the answer to Question 1.4 but with ( N+1 )i n

In the case of the non-recombining tree, there are 20+21+22+···+2N=/summ⎬tiontextN
i=02i=2N+1−1 nodes. There is a simple trick to get this last result
if you cannot recall it. Let S=/summ⎬tiontextN

Answer 2.60: The derivatives will give more leverage than the stock, so you
should use a derivative. If you can only go long, then buying a call option
is expensive because you are paying for the embedded downside protection
of a put option via put-call parity type arguments (see Crack [2021, Section
3.6]). With non-stochastic interest rates, the forward and futures prices are
the same (Cox and Rubinstein [1985, p. 62]). It comes down to a question
of margin/collateral. If the forward contract requires no collateral, and the
futures contract requires a margin deposit, then the forward contract will
provide more “bang for your buck.”
Answer 2.61: I think the interviewer wants a directional answer only and an
explanation. So, if you are peeking here for advice, then go away and ﬁgure
out only whether the call price should rise or fall.
Most stocks have positive betas, and the call option (as a leveraged investment
in the stock) will therefore have a very large positive beta and a high positive
expected return. For example, suppose a $50 stock has a beta of βS=1.10.
Then an at-the-money six-month European call option on the stock (assume
r=0.05,σ=0.30) has a beta of βc=6.719837 under Black-Scholes assump-
tions.70This is an “instantaneous beta” because as soon as the stock price
changes, the degree of leverage in the call changes and the call’s beta changes
(but it will still be higher than the stock’s beta). So, the expected return on
the option is positive and tomorrow’s expected price is higher than today’s.
See also the answer to the next question where I take this one step further and
use Itˆ o’s Lemma to derive an approximate numerical answer for the speciﬁc
numerical example given above.
Answer 2.62: Now, how do we reconcile Answer 2.61 (call price expected to rise)
with negative theta (i.e., time decay)? An option’s theta is the sensitivity of
the option price to the passage of time holding all else constant. You cannot
look at this in isolation because all else is not held constant over the next
24 hours. To reconcile the positive expected return on the option with the
negative theta, we need a formula that uses a total diﬀerential.
If we were working with deterministic functions, we would simply write
dc=∂c
∂tdt+∂c
∂SdS=Θdt+∆dS. (†)
We could then talk about how delta is positive (i.e., ∆ ≡∂c
∂S>0) and how
the expected value of dSis positive (because stock price is expected to rise
on average) and how this outweighs the negative time decay term (i.e., the
negative theta: Θ ≡∂c
∂t<0) and so on. This is, however, quite wrong here!
70The relationship is βc=ΩβS,w h e r eΩ ≡N(d1)·S
c=∆·S
cis the elasticity of the call price
with respect to the stock price (Cox and Rubinstein [1985, p. 190]). In this example we have
c=4.817438 ,S= 50, and N(d1)=∆=0 .588589 .
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 264 All Rights Reserved WorldwideContinuing with the numerical at-the-money call example from Answer 2.61,
on the stock with beta 1.10, and using a 10% expected return for a CAPM
Market portfolio (see notes at the end of this section), I have the following num-
bers: Θ = −5.357262, dt=1
365,∆=0 .588589, E(dS)≈0.013679 (see notes
at end of this question). So, ∆ E(dS)≈$0.008051, but Θ dt=−$0.014677, so
the total diﬀerential above (i.e., equation ( †)) would give E(dc)=−$0.006626
which contradicts that fact that the expected return on the call is positive.
What is missing is that the total diﬀerential above (i.e., equation ( †)) applies
only to deterministic functions. The call price is stochastic, driven by the
stochastic S.W ec a n n o tu s et h es t a t e dt o t a ld i ﬀ e r e n t i a lb e c a u s ei th a sat e r m

dc=∂c

∂SdS+1
2∂2c
∂S2(dS)2
=Θdt+∆dS+1
2Γ(dS)2,
where Γ ≡∂2c
∂S2. Continuing the numerical example above, we have Γ =
0.036681, and E[(dS)2]≈$0.617039 (see notes at end of this question), so
then we get
E(dc)=Θ dt+∆E(dS)+1

=$ 0 .004691 .
This is roughly a 10 bps increase in value from c=$ 4 .817438. That is, the
time decay contributes a negative component to the expected change in the
call price, but the expected values of the stochastic terms contribute positive
values that more than oﬀset the time decay.
We can now continue our answer to Question 2.61 and assert that for this
particular example, Itˆ o’s Lemma implies that c=$ 4.817438 today and E(c+
dt)≈4.817438 + 0 .004691 = 4 .822129 tomorrow.
In simple terms, the contributions to the expected change in call price are:
a negative term for the time decay, a positive term for the call’s delta and
the positive expected return on the stock, and a positive return for the call’s
gamma and the volatility of the stock.

notation is not strictly correct for a non-inﬁnitesimal time step. The same
can be said of using the notation dSanddcfor non-inﬁnitesimal moves in the
stock and call prices, respectively. I am simply going to ignore this loose use
of notation and continue. If you are not happy with that then you are not
ready to interview with a ﬁnance ﬁrm. I gave numbers for E(dS)a n d E[(dS)2]
without saying where they came from. Here are the minimum details: If µ

dt·ϵ,
where ϵ∼N(0,1). In this case, dS=S(t+dt)−S(t), and we can use the
properties of normal and lognormal distributions (see Question 4.33) to deduce
that E(dS)=S(t)(eµdt−1) and E[(dS)2]=S2(t)(e2(µ+1
2σ2)dt−2eµdt+1 ).
You can also reproduce the value of E(dc)a l m o s te x a c t l yb yu s i n gt h eC A P M
information in the answer. Note however that the E(dc) number implied by
the CAPM will match the E(dc) value calculated using Itˆ o’s Lemma only in
the limit as dt→0.71If you want to use the CAPM then you should use
what approximates an instantaneous CAPM (a CAPM deﬁned only over the
time step dt). I used dt=1
365,r=0.05,Rf=er·dt−1,rM=l n ( 1+0 .10),
E(RM)=erM·dt−1,µS,simple =Rf+βS(E(RM)−Rf),µ=1

βc=∆·S·βS/c,µc,simple =Rf+βc(E(RM)−Rf),E(dc)CAPM =c·µc,simple .
71This is because the CAPM relationship between βcandβSgiven in Footnote 70 is only true in
an instantaneous CAPM, and this holds only for an inﬁnitesimal time step. If I look at the ratio of

This is called the “St. Petersburg Game.” The fact that the expected payoﬀ
to the game is inﬁnite, and that no one in his or her right mind would pay
more than a few hundred dollars to play, is why it is sometimes called the “St.
Petersburg Paradox.” There are several ways that you can think about this
sensibly.
One way is to note that “value” is not the same thing as “expected payoﬀ”;1
value equals utility of expected payoﬀ. Most people cannot distinguish between
very large amounts of money.2This means that $250is not worth twice $249.
However, these very large amounts are counted in exactly this way when cal-
culating expected payoﬀ to the game as a whole. If you think that $2k=$ 250
(essentially) for all k≥50, then the expected payoﬀ to the game is ﬁnite:

you pay your customer to play? How much would you charge your customer?
1It is important to note that the Weak Law of Large Numbers fails if the expectation is not
ﬁnite (Feller [1968, pp. 251]).
2Bernoulli ([1738]; [1954]) suggests that utility of payoﬀs should depend upon how wealthy you
are. For a practitioner’s view of utility, see Kritzman (1992a).
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 267 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAPPENDIX C. OTHER FINANCIAL ECONOMICS ANSWERS
A second way to think about this is in terms of default risk.3We need to
quote the bid (what we pay) and the ask (what the customer pays). For the
bid, it is the customer’s default risk we need to worry about. Let us assume
aw e a l t h yc u s t o m e rw h od e f a u l t sa b o v eo n em i l l i o nd o l l a r s . I nt h i sc a s e ,t h e
customer defaults after (about) 20 tosses. Assuming the investment bank is
of large scale, a payoﬀ from the customer between two dollars and one million
dollars is of relatively small size. The investment bank takes such bets every
day, and this one is uncorrelated with all the others. At this level, we could
argue that the investment bank is risk-neutral and so the bid is exactly $20
with no risk premium.
For the ask, it is the company that risks bankruptcy and default. Let us
assume that the company ﬁles for bankruptcy after losing one billion dollars
(on the order of magnitude of Barings, and Metallgesellschaft)—approximately
$230.T h e e x p e c t e d v a l u e o f t h e g a m e t o t h e c u s t o m e r i s t h u s a b o u t $ 3 0 —
the bank defaults after 30 tosses. However, your career and the holdings of
all the shareholders can be destroyed by this bet, so you had better add a
considerable risk premium. You might want to go all the way up to $200 and
quote a bid-ask of ($20, $200)—it depends upon your degree of risk aversion.
Each of these two solutions uses a truncation method. Another related way to
think about this is in terms of feasibility. If it does take more than 50 tosses
to get a head, then the payoﬀ is not feasible because $250is more dollars than
there are atoms in the universe, and whoever sold the ticket to the game is—by
the laws of physics—unable to pay. See also Feller (1968, pp. 251–253).
Answer 3.2: This is a frequent question. Assuming continuously compounded
returns follow an arithmetic Brownian motion (see Crack [2021]), variance of
returns grows linearly with the compounding period. This is because consec-
utive returns in a random walk are independent, and the variance of a sum
of independent random variables is just the sum of the variances. This means
that the four-year σ2equals four times the one-year σ2.I t f o l l o w s t h a t t h e
four-year σis two times the one-year σ. The answer is, therefore, 20%. See
also Question 2.18.
Answer 3.3: This is a very common term-structure question. You should be able
to do this in your head almost instantly. Think of it this way: the rate over
the ﬁrst ﬁve years and the rate over the second ﬁve years must average out
to give the rate over the full 10 years. That is, the average of 10% and the
unknown forward rate must give 15%. The unknown must be 20%. To work
it out quickly, note that the unknown (20%) is as far above the average (15%)
as the known (10%) is below it.

Answer 3.4: There are many diﬀerent types of bond yield. The “yield” on a bond
is usually the “internal rate of return” or “yield-to-maturity” or “promised
yield”; it is what you earn if you hold the bond to maturity assuming a con-
stant reinvestment rate. In practice, given that reinvestment rates can vary
signiﬁcantly from your initial promised yield, your actual return can be higher
or lower.
The “rate of return” on a bond is the internal rate of return of the realized
cash ﬂows to the bond-holder including reinvestment. If the bond is sold before
maturity, the (realized) rate of return can be positive or negative.
Suppose you buy a bond promising 5%, but interest rates rise dramatically
soon after your purchase. If you then sell the bond, you record a capital loss
and a negative rate of return. However, if you hold the bond to maturity, you
get your promised 5% plus a bit more because of higher reinvestment rates on
the coupons.
Answer 3.5: Chaos theory came out of MIT in the early 1960’s. Professor Ed-
ward N. Lorenz (Professor Emeritus in the department of Earth, Atmospheric
and Planetary Science from 1987 until his death in early 2008) discovered that
computer-simulated nonlinear mathematical equations describing the evolu-
tion of weather patterns are very sensitive to the starting values of the variables
(Lorenz [1963]).4
This “sensitive dependence on initial conditions” is the ﬁrst of three charac-
teristics most often associated with chaos theory. The second characteristic is
that the nonlinear systems describing chaotic systems are non-random. That
is, they are “deterministic,” not “stochastic.” However, the output of the (often
very simple nonlinear) systems can appear quite random. The third charac-
teristic is “self-similarity”: the physical system looks similar at diﬀerent levels
of magniﬁcation. It is self-similarity that gives rise to the “fractals” that you
may have seen elsewhere. Fractals are often associated with the mathemati-
cian Benoit Mandelbrot (who died aged 85 in 2010 while a Professor Emeritus
of Mathematics at Yale).
4I had the pleasure of attending some Independent Activities Period (IAP) classes taught by
Prof. Lorenz at MIT in 1994/1995. He reminded me a little of a slim Dave Thomas (you know, the
Wendy’s guy). Although in his late seventies he seemed younger and very good-natured. Lorenz
died in 2008 aged 90.

There are several diﬀerent deﬁnitions of “chaos” in the literature. These deﬁ-
nitions are beyond the scope of this book. See Brock et al. (1991, pp. 8–17) for
further details. For a low-level broad introduction to chaos, see Gleick (1987).
Can you use chaos theory in ﬁnance? This was a hot topic in the late 1980’s
and early 1990’s. Many academic economics and ﬁnance papers were written
on the subject. The few that made any sense found nothing reliable. The
others were written by ignorant people who jumped on the bandwagon; they
should never have published their empty papers.
After reading more than 150 journal articles and half a dozen books on chaos
theory and writing a 100-page Masters-level thesis on chaos theory applied to
ﬁnancial economics and publishing one paper in the Journal of Finance ,Ia m
quite pessimistic. My co-author and I hypothesized considerable discreteness-
induced bias in the popular “BDS test” for chaos in equity data (Crack and
Ledoit [1996]). Our hypothesis has now been conﬁrmed (Kr¨ amer and Runde
[1997]).
If you want to predict stock returns, I recommend that you use neural nets
or some other nonlinear technique. In my opinion, any predictability that you
can discern with chaos theory (e.g., “nearest neighbor” prediction techniques)
is better investigated using the other nonlinear techniques available to you.
Give it up—chaos theory is great in the physical sciences, but it is a lost cause
in ﬁnance.
Answer 3.6: Look at Table C.1 on p. 279. The slope of the price-yield curve
is−D
(1+r)P,w h e r e Dis Macaulay duration, Pis bond price, and ris yield.
Changing slope (i.e., curvature) is driven almost entirely by changing P,b e -
cause Macaulay duration, D, changes very little with changing yield, r(Crack
and Nawalkha [2001]). Ddoes, however, fall slowly with rising yield for a stan-
dard bond with coupons, and this does contribute marginally to curvature.
Note that curvature (i.e., changing slope) of the plot does notalways imply that
the Macaulay duration of a bond is changing (Crack and Nawalkha [2001])!
This is a common misconception (it is easy to misconstrue this in Fabozzi and
Fabozzi [1995, pp. 97–98]). For example, consider a zero-coupon bond with
ten years to maturity. The plot of bond value versus bond yield is downward
sloping with curvature. Whatever the yield, however, the bond’s duration is
ten years because it is a ten-year zero
Am a t h e m a t i c a le x p l a n a t i o no ft h ec o n v e x i t y :y o uk n o wt h a tt h ec u r v es l o p e s
downward, it goes to a vertical asymptote at yield -1 and a horizontal asymp-
tote at yield inﬁnity. You know that the curve must be smooth because the
pricing relationship is simple and well-behaved. The only way to get a well-
behaved smooth curve in this situation is to have it be convex.
Answer 3.7: This question is an interesting intersection of theory and empirical
reality. The question is not necessarily well-posed, but you should do your
best to answer it. I give what I think is the best answer possible.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 270 All Rights Reserved WorldwideIf the empirical security market line (SML) is wholly above the theoretical one,
this means that stocks are under-priced relative to the CAPM. I propose two
possible causes: First, maybe there is only one risk factor (the Market), but
market participants require higher compensation per unit of beta-risk than
suggested by the CAPM; second, maybe there is more than one risk factor,
and market participants require compensation for factors not mentioned by
the CAPM. Conversely, if the empirical SML is wholly below the theoretical
one, then stocks are overpriced relative to the CAPM. In this case, market
participants do not require as much compensation per unit of beta-risk as
theory suggests.
It h i n kt h eb e s ta n s w e ri st os a yt h a tt h eC A P Md o e sn o ta c c o u n tf o ra l l
priced risk factors. It is likely, however, that beta is priced. It follows that
stocks require a premium over and above that suggested by CAPM, and you
could think of this as an empirical SML plotting above the theoretical one.
For more on factor models and estimation, see Kritzman (1993a).
There have been several papers pronouncing the CAPM either dead or alive
(Wallace [1980]; Fama and French [1992]; Black [1993]; Fama and French
[1996]). For a friendly introduction to the CAPM, see Mullins (1992). Fergu-
son and Shockley (2003) show that even if the traditional single-factor CAPM
holds, use of an equity-only proxy for the World Market Portfolio of Risky As-
sets leads to an errors-in-variables mis-estimation of CAPM betas. This error
in turn means that variables related to leverage will help to explain returns
because they serve as instruments for the missing beta risk. The upshot of all
this is that many empirical anomalies we see are in fact consistent with the
single-beta CAPM.
You should note that there are some theoretical problems with both the ques-
tion and my answer. It is quite diﬃcult (if not impossible) to get either of
the empirical SML’s mentioned. This is not because the CAPM is “correct,”
or because there is only one risk factor. Rather, it is because there is a very
tight mathematical relationship between betas and returns (Sharpe [1964];
Roll [1977a]). You would certainly need that the market proxy is not mean-
variance eﬃcient to get the plots suggested. It is probably not suﬃcient to
simply assume that there are risk factors not accounted for by the CAPM. Go
with the answer above, but realize that there is more here than meets the eye.
Answer 3.8: This question is very similar to Question 3.3 (and is just as com-
mon). You should be able to do it in your head almost instantly. If you cannot,
then go back and try Question 3.3 again before reading on.
The rate over the ﬁrst year and the rate over the second year must average out
to give the rate over the full two years. That is, the average of 7.15% and the
unknown forward rate must give 7.60%. The unknown rate must be around
8.05% (remember, it is as far above 7.60% as 7.15% is below 7.60%).

In fact, if you work it out exactly, the forward rate is
/⎭r⎬cketleft⎜igg
(1.0760)2
(1.0715)1/⎭r⎬cketright⎜igg
−1=8 .052% .
You are making a “ﬁrst-order” approximation when doing the simple averag-
ing, and the answer is quite accurate.
Answer 3.9: This is introductory ﬁnance theory; it uses no-arbitrage and not
much more. Assume for the sake of simplicity that interest rates are constant
atrper unit time, today is time t,a n dt h ef o r w a r dc o n t r a c tm a t u r e sa tt i m e
T. The forward price, F(t, T), is related to the spot price, S(t), as follows:
F(t, T)=S(t)er(T−t)≥S(t)
The discount bond sells at a forward premium because of no-arbitrage.
The coupon bond is a diﬀerent story. If you assume a continuous coupon of
ρper unit time, then the forward price, F(t, T), is related to the spot price,
S(t), as follows:
F(t, T)=S(t)e(r−ρ)(T−t)≤S(t),
where the inequality follows because we were told that r≤ρ.T h e c o u p o n
bond sells at a forward discount because of no-arbitrage.
For a practitioner’s view on futures, forwards, and hedging, see Kritzman
(1993c).
Answer 3.10: This is a classic question, and a very good test of your dexterity
with elementary ﬁnance theory. If you have not yet ﬁgured it out, and you
are peeking at the answers for a hint, I strongly recommend that you go back
to the question and try again; read no further. If you are still reading, here is
ah i n t : t h i n ka b o u ty o u ri n v e s t m e n th o r i z o n ,a n da ni m m u n i z a t i o ns t r a t e g y .
Now go back and try again.
Your investment horizon is very short. You want to proﬁt from the change
in the relationship between short- and long-term rates. However, you want
to protect yourself from shifts in the level of the yield curve. That is, you
want your position to be insensitive to parallel shifts in the yield curve, but
positively sensitive to a steepening. This suggests that you should go short
long-term debt, go long short-term debt, and match both the duration and
price of the positions (i.e., use very low coupon short-term debt and very high
coupon long-term debt).5
You may think of this as a “zero-duration” portfolio (to match your horizon).
However, in just the same way that a zero net investment stock portfolio has no
well-deﬁned beta but can still be market-neutral, a zero net investment bond
5If you cannot match durations of the positions, you can match on the product of duration ×
price. However, this will no longer be a zero net investment strategy.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 272 All Rights Reserved Worldwideportfolio has no well-deﬁned duration but can still be insensitive to parallel
shifts in the yield curve.
Traders tell me that this strategy originated with the Salomon Bond arbitrage
(“bond-arb”) group. However, it is now so well known that proﬁts may be
slim. See also Chincarini (2012, Box 2.2, pp.17–18).
For more on “Yield Curve Strategies,” see the excellent papers by Jones (1991)
and Litterman and Scheinkman (1991). Jones describes the statistical rela-
tionship between changes in level, slope, and curvature of the yield curve.
Answer 3.11: For a standard bond, with annual coupons, the Macaulay duration
(Macaulay [1938]) is just the weighted-average term-to-maturity of the bond,

andVis bond value. Note that the weights ωtsum to one, and that duration
is measured in units of time, as is the term-to-maturity.
The weights ωtare applied to the timing of the bond’s cash ﬂows. Each weight
is equal to the present value of the particular cash ﬂow as a proportion of the
total value of the bond. It follows that the duration of a zero-coupon bond
equals its term-to-maturity—because the weight of the ﬁnal cash ﬂow is +1.
If the bond pays mcoupons per annum (e.g., m= 2 in the case of a semi-
annual bond), then Equations C.1 and C.2 are replaced by Equations C.3.

Duration is a measure of how sensitive a bond’s price is to changes in interest
rates. Duration is related to, but diﬀers from, the slope of the plot of bond
price versus yield-to-maturity (Crack and Nawalkha [2001]).
Iﬁ n dt h ef o l l o w i n gc o n s t r u c t i o nt ob ea ni n s t r u c t i v ew a yo fu n d e r s t a n d i n g
how duration works.6Suppose that you have a liability due in the future
and that you buy a bond now with the intention of using the bond (and its
reinvested coupons) to meet the liability (the maturity of the bond is assumed
to be greater than or equal to the maturity of the liability). Suppose that
the present value of the bond is identical to the present value of the liability.
Suppose that you open a bank account that earns the market interest rate
(i.e., the yield-to-maturity of the bond). You deposit all cash in-ﬂows from
the bond in the bank account and let them compound through time (with no
taxes or transaction costs). When your liability falls due, you sell your bond
and close your bank account. Call the proceeds of the bond sale together with
your ﬁnal bank balance the “Terminal Value.”
Can you meet your liability with the Terminal Value? Well, there are two
risks involved. A fall in interest rates immediately after you purchase the
bond pushes up the price at which you are able to sell your bond. However, a
fall in interest rates also decreases your ﬁnal bank balance because you earn
less interest on the coupons. The opposite obtains with a rise in interest rates.
That is, higher interest rates decrease the price at which you can sell the bond,
but your closing bank balance is higher because you earn more interest on the
coupons. These two risks are known as price risk andcoupon reinvestment
rate risk ,r e s p e c t i v e l y .
Price risk and coupon reinvestment rate risk have opposite inﬂuences on the
Terminal Value. The Terminal Value diﬀers depending upon which inﬂuence is
strongest. It can be proved that if your liability falls due before the weighted-
average term-to-maturity of your bond, the price risk has the stronger inﬂuence
on Terminal Value. If, however, your liability falls due after the weighted-
average term-to-maturity of your bond, the coupon reinvestment rate risk has
the stronger inﬂuence on Terminal Value. If your liability falls due precisely at
the weighted-average term-to-maturity of the bond, the Terminal Value is rel-
atively insensitive to an immediate change in interest rates. By deﬁnition, the
weighted-average term-to-maturity of the bond is just its Macaulay duration.
Redington (1952, p. 289) introduced the word “immunization” to refer to a
particular type of liability matching involving “investment of the assets in such
aw a yt h a tt h ee x i s t i n g[ i n s u r a n c e ]b u s i n e s si si m m u n et oag e n e r a lc h a n g ei n
the rate of interest.” He also says that the distribution of the term of the
ﬁxed income assets in relation to the term of the liabilities should be “in such
a way as to reduce the possibility of loss arising from a change in interest
rates” (Redington, 1952, p. 289). This requires both that the value of the
6I have not seen my construction in the literature. Kritzman (2003, Chapter 7), however, comes
close to this explanation when he gives some elementary insights into duration and convexity.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 274 All Rights Reserved Worldwideassets and liabilities match and that the durations of assets and liabilities
match (Redington, 1952, p. 290). Note that an initial immunized position
protects you from exactly one immediate parallel shock to a ﬂat term-structure
(Redington, 1952, p. 292; Shiu, 1990). This shock is assumed to be very small
(Redington, 1952, p. 290; Shiu, 1990). You are no longer immunized after
that shock has hit because it changes present values and duration. Although
you are no longer immunized, you still have a non-immunized hedge in place.
That is, you still get your planned future Terminal Value as long as no more
shocks hit.
Note that you must re-balance after each shock to stay immunized. In fact,
to stay immunized, you must rebalance even if no shocks hit. This is because,
absent a zero-coupon bond position, changes in bond duration are not in lock-
step with the passage of time. So, your horizon and your bond’s duration
decrease at diﬀerent speeds, and you become non-immunized.
Im u s te m p h a s i z et h a tm yb a n ka c c o u n t / T e r m i n a lV a l u ec o n s t r u c t i o ni sa n
artiﬁcial one. The fact that you must rebalance your position as time passes
(in order to remain immunized) means that you cannot stick with the same
bond until the liability is due. Indeed, the only bond that you can hold until
the liability falls due (while remaining immunized) is a zero-coupon bond with
maturity equal to the maturity of the liability; and in this case, the absence
of coupons removes the need for the bank account in the construction.
So, if you can open a bank account that pays the yield-to-maturity on your
bond, purchase a coupon bond with duration and present value the same as
those of the liability, and deposit all coupons in the bank account until the
liability falls due, then, if there is one and only one small parallel shock to
the ﬂat term-structure of interest rates between now and your liability falling
due, and if that single shift in interest rates occurs immediately, then the
Terminal Value will meet your liability (although you will not be immunized
against a second shock). You are not, however, immunized against a large
or non-parallel shift in the yield curve (Redington, 1952, p. 290, 294; Shiu,
1990).7
Other things being equal, duration increases with increasing term-to-maturity.8
Other things being equal, duration decreases with increasing coupons (larger
cash ﬂows early on decrease the proportional importance of the repayment of
principal at maturity).
Compared to duration, convexity is a higher-order measure of sensitivity of
bond price to interest rates. Convexity is a scaled measure the rate at which
the sensitivity of bond price to interest rates changes with changing interest
rates (Crack and Nawalkha [2001]). Convexity is related to, but diﬀers from,
7See Reitano (1992), Zheng (2007), and Poitras (2013) for discussion of immunization in these
more complicated cases.
8Deeply-discounted coupon-bearing bonds (i.e., bonds paying coupons far below current market
rates) can be an exception (Fisher and Weil [1971, Table 4, p. 418]).

the rate of change of slope of the plot of bond price versus yield-to-maturity.
See the summary in Table C.1. For a practitioner’s view of Macaulay duration
and convexity, see Kritzman (1992b).9
How do the deﬁnitions of duration and convexity arise? Suppose the price of
an annual-coupon bond, P, is expanded in terms of yield-to-maturity, r,u s i n g

is a measure of curvature, or “convexity,” in the plot of bond price versus yield-
to-maturity. Other things (i.e., duration and price) being equal, Cincreases
with increasing coupons. Even a zero-coupon bond has positive convexity
(because C1=C2=···=CT−1=0 ,b u t CT=F a c e >0).
9The standard Macaulay duration is a relatively simple concept. People on The Street expect
you to know that they use more complex tools. For example, the standard Macaulay duration can
be generalized to allow for immunization against parallel shifts in yield curves that are notﬂat.
This generalization was originally proposed by Macaulay (1938), but was made popular by Fisher
and Weil (1971). An even more sophisticated measure of duration is presented by Cox, Ingersoll,
and Ross (1979). Duration measures for bonds with embedded options are also important (Mehran
and Homaifar [1993]).
10Note that this is similar to expressing the change in the price of a call option (given a change
in the level of the underlying) in terms of the “delta” and the “gamma. ” The delta is the rate of
change of call price with respect to underlying, and the gamma measures the “convexity” of call
price with respect to underlying.

©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 276 All Rights Reserved WorldwideIn addition to immunization, duration and convexity enable you to estimate
the impact on bond price of a change in interest rates. A “ﬁrst-order” estimate
uses duration; a “second-order” estimate uses duration and convexity. Higher-
order approximations are more accurate.
Take a 20-year bond paying an annual coupon of 7%. Assume a face value of
$1,000. Assume that the term-structure is ﬂat at 10%. The price of the bond
is $744.59 under these assumptions.
If the entire term-structure rises by one percentage point (i.e., 0.01), what
is the new price of the bond? This can be estimated using the equation we
derived previously:12
∆P
P≈−∆r
1+rD+(∆r)2
2!C
The Macaulay duration of this bond is calculated as 10.0018 years, the convex-
ityCcan be calculated as 130.04676, ∆ r=+ 0 .01,r=0.10, and P=$ 7 4 4 .59,
thus:
∆P≈−∆r
1+rD×P+(∆r)2
2!C×P
=−0.01
1.10×10×$744.59 +(0.01)2
2×130.04676 ×$744.59
=−$67.69 + $4 .84
=−$62.85
Thus, P(r+∆r)≈P+∆P=$ 7 4 4 .59−$62.85 = $681 .74.Direct evaluation
gives the answer as $681.47 (the estimate is 27 cents too high and would have
been out by roughly $5 if not for the convexity term).
If the entire term-structure falls by one percentage point (i.e., 0.01), the change
in bond price is estimated as follows:
∆P≈−∆r
1+rD×P+(∆r)2
2!C×P
=+0.01
1.10×10×$744.59 +(0.01)2
2×130.04676 ×$744.59
=+ $ 6 7 .69 + $4 .84
=+ $ 7 2 .53
Thus, P(r+∆r)≈P+∆P=$ 7 4 4 .59 + $72 .53 = $817 .12.Direct evaluation
gives the answer as $817.43 (the estimate is 31 cents too low and would have
been out by roughly $5 if not for the convexity term).13
12Note that the termD

Note that the “27 cents too high” and the “31 cents too low” in the above
examples can be reduced to pennies (at least) by using a third term in the
expansion—a measure of rate of change of convexity with respect to yield.
Mehran and Homaifar (1993) refer to this third term as “velocity,” though
that name is not commonly used. Thus, they represent change in bond price
as a function of duration, convexity, and velocity—see Mehran and Homaifar
(1993) for more details.14
Macaulay duration may be written using a closed-form formula (i.e., with no
summation term). Let us deﬁne the following function:
d(F,C,r,T )=1+r
r−/⎭r⎬celeft⎜ig
(1 + r)+T/⎭r⎬cketleft⎜ig
C
F−r/⎭r⎬cketright⎜ig/⎭r⎬ceright⎜ig

F[(1 + r)T−1] +r,where r̸=0.(C.4)
Then for a standard bond with annual coupons of C,a n df a c ev a l u e F,
the Macaulay duration in Equations C.1 and C.2 may be rewritten as D=
d(F,C,r,T ). If the bond pays mcoupons per annum (e.g., m=2i nt h ec a s e
of a semi-annual bond) still totaling C,t h e nE q u a t i o n sC . 3m a yb er e w r i t t e n
asD=1
md(F, C/m,r/m,m T ). The proof of this result uses the standard
closed-form formula for an annuity and, although not diﬃcult, may be a little
tedious—a similar type of expression exists for convexity.
Note that D∗=D/(1 + r) in Table C.1 generalizes to D∗=D/(1 + r/m)
in the case of a bond paying mcoupons per period. So, taking the limit as
m→∞(i.e., as we move to continuous compounding), we get D=D∗,a s
mentioned in the caption to Table C.1.
Finally, let me exorcise a myth. Most of the foregoing is predicated on parallel
shifts in yield curves. Other things (i.e., price and duration) being equal, the
higher the convexity of a bond, the better oﬀ you are if there is a parallel
shift (up or down) in a yield curve: hence the myth that you should pay for
convexity.15In reality, these shifts are anything but parallel (Jones [1991];
Litterman and Scheinkman [1991]). Other things (i.e., price and duration)
being equal, if the yield curve steepens, additional convexity will probably
hurt you. Whether additional convexity helps or hurts depends upon the
bonds you consider, and the “twist” in the yield curve that occurs. Crack and
and convexity measures work and where the approximations break down. This simple example
is a good way to do that. In a real world situation, you might know the current value of your
bond portfolio and its duration and convexity. It may be easier (and much faster) to estimate how
your portfolio changes in value with changes in interest rates—using current value, duration, and
convexity—than it is to directly evaluate each bond individually.
14People on The Street tell me that duration measures accounting for embedded options are
important. Mehran and Homaifar (1993) discuss duration and convexity for bonds with embedded
options. Before looking at Mehran and Homaifar (1993), be sure that both your mathematics and
ﬁnance are up to scratch. They have the ideas correct, but their notation is contrary to conventional
symbolic mathematics.
15This win-win situation is not kosher. A model that allows only parallel shifts in the yield curve
freely admits arbitrage opportunities: match on price and duration and go long high convexity and
short low convexity (Shiu, 1990; Lacey and Nawalkha 1993).

Nawalkha (2000) derive simple expressions that allow bond portfolio managers
to capture the combined eﬀects of term-structure height, slope and curvature
shifts on duration, convexity, and higher-order bond risk measures. See Kahn
and Lochoﬀ (1990) and Lacey and Nawalkha (1993) for empirical evidence.
Answer 3.12: From empirical investigations, it is known that stock returns do
not have constant variance through time and that periods of high (low) volatil-
ity tend to follow periods of high (low) volatility (Fama [1965]; Akgiray [1989]).
The GARCH model attempts to capture this empirical fact.
Suppose you estimate a simple linear model like rit=αi+βirmt+uit(return
on stock iat time tis a constant plus a constant times return on the market
plus a residual). If you do not take account of changes in the variance of uit
through time, you can draw faulty statistical inferences about αiandβi.N o t e
that the standard ordinary least squares (OLS) regression does not account
for changing variance. In remedying this problem, the GARCH estimation
captures a portion of stock price behavior that might otherwise be interpreted
as non-normality and might lead to faulty inferences.
The GARCH model is a generalization of the ARCH model ﬁrst presented in
Engle (1982).16The formal GARCH(1,1) model for the residuals of a market
model of stock returns is17

16The review paper by Bera and Higgins (1993) is the best overview of ARCH and GARCH
models that I have seen. Following this, you might look at Bera et al. (1988) as an introduction to
ARCH, and also as an introduction to Engle (1982). For an introduction to statistical models for
ﬁnancial market volatility, see Engle (1993) and his references. For a higher-level review of ARCH
modelling in ﬁnance, see Bollerslev et al. (1992). For a concise overview of the broad econometric
peculiarities of the ARCH(1) model, see Hendry (1986).
17If you remove the term hit−1from the second moment of the GARCH(1,1) model, you get the
ARCH(1) model.

Bollerslev (1986) and Greene (1993) for more on the GARCH model.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 280 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAnswer 3.13: The question does not specify whether you hold T-bonds or cor-
porate bonds. In the case of a T-bond holding, you can reduce your exposure
(i.e., hedge) by shorting T-bond futures contracts. Each Chicago Board of
Trade (CBOT) T-bond contract covers a face value of $100,000 of T-bonds. If
the duration of your bond is the same as the duration of the cheapest-to-deliver
(CTD) T-bond, then you short$50,000,000
$100 ,000= 500 contracts.19If the duration of
your bond is diﬀerent from the duration of the CTD T-bond, then you adjust
for durations: go shortDB
DF×$50,000,000
$100 ,000=DB
DF×500 contracts, where DBis
the duration of your bonds, and DFis the duration of the CTD T-bond.
Note that you could hedge by shorting Eurodollar futures (the underlying is
the interest rate on a three-month $1 million Eurodollar deposit). However,
the short end of the yield curve does not move with the long end. It, there-
fore, makes sense to use a hedging instrument whose underlying interest has
maturity as close as possible to the portfolio to be hedged.
If you hold corporate bonds, then you can still hedge using T-bond futures
(Kuberek and Peﬂey, 1983; Edwards and Ma, 1992, p. 343), but changes in
default risk premia will move the price of your corporate bond with little or no
eﬀect on the T-bond futures. This is really an example of cross hedging. You
can get the hedging ratio by regressing say, monthly, price changes of your
corporate bond on monthly price changes of the near-month T-bond futures.

Answer 3.14: “Brady bonds” are sovereign bonds issued by developing coun-
tries in exchange for previously rescheduled bank loans. They are either “Par”
bonds or “Discount” bonds. The former were issued at the par value of the
loans but carry a below-market interest rate; the latter were issued at a dis-
count from the face value of the former loans but carry a (ﬂoating) market
interest rate. About a quarter of the market value of Brady bonds is collat-
eralized by U.S. Treasury issues. The size of this collateralization means that
Brady bonds are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. In fact, something
like a quarter of the variation in price movements of Brady bonds is (statis-
tically) explained by moves in U.S. Treasuries (sometimes with a lag of one
day). Mexico has retired all its Brady bonds, but the arguments apply more
generally, so I kept the question.21
Let us assume that the yield on the Brady bond increases by 25 bps (i.e., one
quarter of the U.S. Treasury yield change). If we assume that the duration of
the Brady bond is about 15 years, that the bond is trading at around par of

With these assumptions, my guess is that the Brady bond price goes down by
about three or four percentage points.
Answer 3.15: This question is similar to Question 3.10. The zero-coupon cor-
porate bond has the same duration as longer-term coupon-bearing treasuries.
You should short the corporate bond and buy treasuries that have the same
duration and value as the corporate bond. By matching on duration and value,
you create a zero-net investment portfolio that reaps proﬁts.
Of course, you could just trade the treasuries, going long long-term bonds and
short short-term bonds.
Answer 3.16: First of all, the 5/10 time span is not relevant. The same result
holds for a 1/2-year time span. That is, if the one-year interest rate is 10%,
and two-year interest rate is 15%, then the forward rate for the second year
is close to, but strictly greater than, 20%. Second, the order of the rates is
not important. That is, if the two-year rate is 15%, and the forward rate for
the second year is 10%, then the one-year rate is close to, but strictly greater
than, 20%. Third, the result holds for eﬀective (i.e., simple) interest rates
but does not hold for continuously compounded interest rates (for which the
approximation is exact).
The argument relies upon the way in which the interest on your interest accu-
mulates. If you are oﬀered 10% for the ﬁrst year and 20% for the second year,
you will not do as well as if you are oﬀered the average (15%) for two years.
Although the interest on the principal is the same in both cases (and equal to
30%), the interest on the interest is not the same (15% of 15% equals 2.25%
and exceeds 20% of 10%, which is only 2%). To avoid arbitrage, the “plug”
rate has to exceed 20%. That was the “plain English” approach.
The result can be proved using math. Let R1andR2be two diﬀerent interest

There is an extensive discussion of arithmetic versus geometric means and
associated biases in Crack (2020b, Section 2.1).
Answer 3.17: If the one-year rate is 12%, and the two-year rate is 18%, then the
forward rate for the second year is 24% to a ﬁrst-order approximation (it is
exactly 24% if these are continuously compounded rates). Let us assume this
is 12% per half-year in the second year. Then your discounted expected payoﬀ
to the game is approximately

=$ 1 .80.
If you can play repeatedly, then you are risk-neutral, and you would pay
anything up to about $1.80 to play this game. If you can play only once, then
you might argue that the amount is so small you are still risk-neutral. If you
multiply everything by a factor of one million, then you’ll need to add a risk
premium to the discount rates, and you will not pay as much to play.23
Answer 3.18: No one wants to trade with the informed (i.e., insider) trader
because you almost always lose to someone who is better informed than you
are (Glosten and Milgrom [1985]). The identity of the informed trader has not
been announced. This means that anytrade could be a losing trade. Traders
will, therefore, be reluctant to trade. This leads directly to decreased trading
volume.
Here is another way to look at it. Uncertainty over the identity of the in-
formed trader means that traders widen their bid-ask spreads to compensate
(on average) for any potential losses. Wider bid-ask spreads is one component
of a decrease in liquidity, and it is usually associated with a decreased volume
of trade (Chordia and Subrahmanyam [1995]).
23The risk premium as a function of the size of the bet is discussed by Tversky and Kahneman
(1981) and Kahneman and Tversky (1982). Tversky and Kahneman (1974) is an earlier article you
might like to read before reading these two.

I have never seen it written down in a book, but it is well known that there are

This question is for the middle case above, and we should put all our money
into the low volatility asset. Unlike the previous question, you just have to
remember the ratio of the standard deviations (only one ratio is feasible for
the standard deviations because the reciprocal ratio would be bigger than 1),
and if the correlation equals the feasible ratio then all money goes into the low
volatility asset. The interviewer is trying to ﬁnd out whether you know this
result.

...I just opened it to the ﬁrst problem and was somewhat taken back by
your solution. If you worked out the math, you would know that your
answer is wrong. If you do not want to work out the math, then you could

correct, you have to do the math. Always do the math... ...Hopefully, not
too many interviewers have read this answer—or there will be lots of poor
quants that will be turned away for being smart. Si ncerely, YT. ”
Like many an overconﬁdent quant, YT jumped into the math without
thinking about the problem. Just as a pickpocket bumps you from the left
while his accomplice takes money out of your right pocket, many of these
questions are set up to distract you. You must be hard wired to ignore the
superﬁcial “pickpocket answer” and home in on the deeper response that is
required.
I sent YT a tactful e-mail telling him politely why he was mistaken
and why no math was needed. I even gave him a challenge quant question to
solve to save face, but he did not respond. I think that his failure to respond
was because he was unable to handle any criticism or admit his mistake
(that would be consistent with his condescending e-mail). This is not what
employers are looking for! Suppose an interviewer pushes you so hard or so
far that you supply the wrong answer to a quant question. If the interviewer
points out your mistake (and they do not always) then you should behave
like a team member who is happy to accept constructive criticism. Do
not get defensive, do not supply any BS; just take it and roll with the punches.

Statistics Answers
This appendix contains answers to the questions posed in Chapter 4.
Answer 4.1: Before giving an algebraic answer, I think you should have a guess.
This shows that you can guess, and it gives you a baseline number to compare
your algebraic answer with, which could produce a warning red ﬂag if you
make a mistake with the algebra.
Obviously, when you buy your ﬁrst cereal box, you get one of the four toys
with probability one on that draw. As you acquire diﬀerent toys, however, the
likelihood that you get the next one in only one draw falls. For example, by
the time you already have three of the four toys, you only have one chance in
four that the next draw will give you the fourth. So, the absolute minimum
number of purchases required is four, but you could buy 100 boxes, and not
get all four toys—though this latter outcome seems very unlikely. Weighing
these odds up, my gut instinct is that it should take something like 10 draws
on average to get all four toys.
Now let us solve the problem algebraically. Consider ﬁrst the more general
problem of having Ttoys. (As an aside, note that the answer we seek must
also be the same as if we roll a T-sided die and we ask how many rolls do we
expect to have to make in order to have seen all Tsides appear.)
Let us give a simple recursion argument. Suppose that Tis the number of
diﬀerent toys we seek. Let us suppose that we are currently attempting to
get our tthtoy, having already found ( t−1) diﬀerent toys. We can immedi-
ately see that the probability, ptthat we get the tthtoy in only one draw is
[T−(t−1)]/T. For example, when seeking the ﬁrst toy, p1=1 ,a n dw h e n
seeking the second toy, p2=(T−1)/T,a n ds oo n .
LetNtbe the number of draws required to obtain the tthtoy, having already
found ( t−1) diﬀerent toys. Then there is probability ptthat we get the tth
toy in one draw, and probability (1 −pt)t h a tw eh a v et od r a wa g a i n . G i v e n

Alternatively, when trying to obtain the tthtoy, consider each cereal box pur-

distribution fNt(n)=P(Nt=n)=pt·qn−1
tforn≥1, counts the number of
trials up to and including the ﬁrst success (Spiegel, 1975; Evans et al., 1993).

Answer 4.2: Imagine the surface f(x, y)=x·yplotted above the unit square.
We need to ﬁnd the area of that part of the domain where f(x, y)=x·y>1/2.
If we project this down onto the x–yspace, we need only ﬁnd the area within
the unit square above the isovalue curve x·y=1 / 2 . T h a ti s ,w en e e dt h e

than one-half of one-quarter of one. So, my initial ballpark guess is a number
slightly greater than 0.125.

The raw, or “non-central,” moments E(Xn),n∈Z,n≥0 are quite messy.
So, let me calculate the easier central moment E[(X−µ)n]r e s u l tﬁ r s t ,a n d
then derive a formula for the non-central moments (which depends upon the
central moments in the standard normal case), and then I will give a table of
both the central and non-central moments up to order 10.
IfX∼N(µ, σ2), then ( X−µ)∼N(0,σ2), and we deduce from the derivation
in Answer 2.31 that the central moments are given by

by symmetry.

Table D.1 gives the central and non-central moments of X∼N(µ, σ2)u pt o

E(Xn)=E[(X−µ)n]+A d j u s t m e n t ( n;µ, σ), (D.5)
where Adjustment( n;µ, σ)=0 ,i f µ= 0. Of course, Equation D.5 is tautolog-

andX−Yare then probabilistically the same. That is, the random variables
X+YandX−Yhave the same mean, the same variance, the same skewness,
the same kurtosis, etc. In other cases (e.g., XandYlognormal or chi-squared,
or normal with non-zero mean), the variance result still holds, but the other
results need not.
Answer 4.6: This sort of question is common. Begin by calculating the expected
payoﬀ to the game. This is given by the summation over the product of
potential outcomes times their probability of occurrence:

If you are selling tickets to repeated plays of this game, you are eﬀectively

your overhead, monopoly power, greed, and so on. You cannot charge $6.00
or above, since no one will play. If the game is to be played only once, then
you are risk-averse. You should charge the expected value, plus your proﬁt
margin, plus a risk premium. The risk premium depends upon how risk-averse
you are.

FIRST SOLUT ION
The original game is stated as “You toss ﬁve coins and I toss four coins. You
win if you get strictly more heads. ” This game is isomorphic to an analytically
simpler game.2“You toss four coins and I toss four coins. Whomever gets the
most heads wins immediately. If we are tied, however, then you toss one more
coin to decide the outcome.” By observation, both stages of this second game
are completely symmetric. So, we each have a probability one-half of winning.

an appeal to symmetry, gives the answer as 1/2 without any calculation. I
derive the answer graphically, with more details than you need.
The key to this more complex solution is to recognize that when p=1 / 2 ,t h e
binomial probability mass function B(N,p) of either player is symmetric, and
1This is an application of the “Weak Law of Large Numbers. ” The law says, essentially, that if
you independently draw repeated observations from the same random distribution, then for very
many drawings, the sample mean is very close to the population mean (DeGroot [1989, p. 229–231]).
In other words, after many repeated plays of the game, the ticket seller can be sure that his average
payout per game is very close to the expected payout per game. Because all that matters is the
expected payout, not the variance of payouts, the ticket seller is eﬀectively risk-neutral. Similarly,
casinos are eﬀectively risk-neutral. With repeated plays, and odds slightly in the favor of “the
house,” the casino expects to be the winner for sure in the long run.

P(X=x) and P(Y=y) are shown in square brackets. The tosses are all

that two people tossing coins independently of each other means that the joint
probability mass function is just the product of the marginals.3
To make the intuition clear, I will consider ﬁrst the simpler case where you toss
only two coins and I toss only one. I give all the ﬁne details to make it clear,
which may be useful in variations of the game, but in fact, no calculation is
needed. Each toss is a Bernoulli trial with probability of success (i.e., a head)
equal to 1/2. The tosses are independent, so the count of heads Ythat y ou
get is distributed binomial: P(Y=y)=/p⎬renleft⎭igN

The random variables YandXare statistically independent of each other,

mean that the joint probability mass function is symmetric in all respects. If
you take a pair of scissors and cut out the shaded cells as a single inverted
staircase, then rotate that through 180 degrees, the contents perfectly match
the contents of the un-shaded cells. So, by symmetry, P(Y> X )=1 / 2 .
marginal binomial distributions shown in square brackets in Table D.2 are
symmetric because p= 1/2. With both marginals symmetric, it must be that
the sum of the joint probabilities in the shaded cells and the sum of the joint
probabilities in the un-shaded cells are the same. The two sums must add to
one, so the sum of the shaded cells must be P(Y> X )=1 / 2 .
Table D.3 shows an analogous table for the case of you tossing ﬁve coins and
me tossing four coins. Again, I have given all the details of the marginal and
joint probability mass functions, but in fact, no numbers are required to do
the calculation. I have given them only to ﬁll in the ﬁne details to back up

©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 294 All Rights Reserved WorldwideStory: 1. Late one winter’s evening at MIT (1994 I think), I was helping
Nobel Prize winner Franco Modigliani operate our photocopier. We somehow
got onto the topic of the Crash of 1987 and he said “Yes, that is when I made
all my money. ” He said he had been watching the market and, thinking it
overvalued, he had bought out-of-the-money index puts (presumably S&P500
index options at that time). He said he made a bundle. He had tried it several
times since then without success.
2. At my oﬃce doorway another time, Modigliani told me that when pro-
nouncing his name I should “drop the ‘g’—it’s the mark of a true Italian”—
and that is how he pronounced it. Modigliani died in 2003 aged 85.
Answer 4.8: Another die-rolling question; they are very popular. You want to
get as many dollars as possible. You let me roll once and look at which
number comes up. You must compare this number to the possible payoﬀs
on the remaining two rolls. If it seems likely that you can do better by not
stopping the game, then you proceed, otherwise you stop me.4
You must work backwards to deduce the best strategy. This is analogous
to pricing an American-style option using a tree method. So, suppose that
you have seen the second roll and are trying to decide whether to ask for a
third. You must compare the outcome of the second roll to the distribution of
possible outcomes on the third roll:

Maximum Payoﬀ $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6
Probability1
61
61
61
61

The expected value of the distribution in Table D.4 is $3.50; the variance is
$2.92; the standard deviation is $1.71. If you see a 4 or higher on the second
roll, you might stop the game because you probably will not do better. If you
get a 3 or lower, you might continue because you expect to do better.
Now, stepping backwards again, suppose that you have just seen the ﬁrst roll.
You must decide whether to ask for a second roll (which may lead to a third).
You must compare the outcome of the ﬁrst roll to the distribution of possible
outcomes if you proceed to a second (and possibly third) roll.
If you ask for the second roll, there is one-half a chance that it yields a 1, 2,
or 3, and one-half a chance that it yields a 4, 5, or 6. Using the argument
above, in the ﬁrst case (1, 2, or 3 on roll two) you proceed to a third roll;
in the second case (4, 5, or 6 on roll 2) you do not proceed. There is thus
one-half a chance that you proceed to a third roll (expected value $3.50 from

Table D.4), and one-half a chance that you stop the game at roll two (expected

+/⎭r⎬cketleft⎭igg1
2×/p⎬renleft⎭igg$4 + $5 + $6
3/p⎬renright⎭igg/⎭r⎬cketright⎭igg
=$ 4.25.
Thus, you would ask for a second roll only if you get a 1, 2, 3, or 4 on roll one.
If you have a 5 or 6 on roll one, you should stop the game.
In simple terms, then, the strategy is to stop the game at roll number one if
a 5 or 6 appears (probability1
3), otherwise continue (probability2
3). If you
continue, stop the game at roll number two if a 4, 5, or 6 appears, otherwise
continue.
Please note that my argument involving expected payoﬀs assumes that you
are risk-neutral; your stopping rule might use lower acceptable payoﬀs if you
are risk-averse, or higher payoﬀs if you are risk-loving.5
The overall expected value of the game may now be calculated.

3≈$4.67.
If you are charging entry to repeated plays of this game, you are eﬀectively
risk-neutral.6You charge the expected value ($4.67) plus a commission. You
add a risk premium to the ticket price if there is only one or a few plays of the
game; the more plays, the lower the risk premium. You would never charge
more than six dollars because the player can never earn more than six dollars.
In the amended game (where I roll the die three times and pay you the max-
imum number of the three rolls), you need the distribution of the maximum

charge a ticket price of $4.96 plus some proﬁt margin for repeated plays. Again,
you cannot charge more than six dollars because no one will play the game.
The second game is more expensive than the ﬁrst game ($4 .96>$4.67) because
it strictly dominates it. That is, the payoﬀ to the second game is never less
than, and often exceeds, the payoﬀ to the ﬁrst game. This is because the
second game guarantees the maximum of three rolls without risk, but the ﬁrst
game does not.
Answer 4.9: The correlation is still ρ.A d d i n g a c o n s t a n t o r m u l t i p l y i n g b y a
constant has no impact on the correlation. Go back to ﬁrst principals and
write out correlation as the ratio of covariance to the product of standard
deviations. Adding a constant to Xhas no eﬀect on either the numerator
or denominator. Multiplying Xby ﬁve multiplies both the numerator and
denominator by ﬁve.
Answer 4.10: This has been a very popular question. Assume that neither of
you peek into your envelopes. Assume that you have $ Xin your envelope,
where $ Xhas a ﬁfty-ﬁfty chance of being either $ mor $2 m.T h i sm e a n st h a t
your opponent’s envelope has a ﬁfty-ﬁfty chance of containing $2 Xor $1

=$ 1.25X.
The expected beneﬁt of switching is, therefore, $0 .25X. On this basis, it looks
as though you should switch envelopes. Of course, if your opponent does not
peek, and she has $ Yin her envelope, exactly the same argument shows that
she has an expected beneﬁt to switching of $0 .25Y.S o ,i tl o o k sa st h o u g hs h e
should switch also. This is the ﬁrst part of the “Exchange Paradox”: it seems
that you both beneﬁt from switching.
Now, suppose that neither of you peek and that you do switch envelopes once.
If you still do not peek, then a repeat of exactly the same argument suggests
an expected beneﬁt of 0 .25 of the contents of your envelope if you switch again.
The same applies to your opponent. This is the second part of the “Exchange
Paradox”: it seems that you could happily switch forever (like a dog chasing
its own tail). The foregoing is the naive answer.
The problem is twofold: First, you are assuming that value is expected payoﬀ
(this is so only if you are genuinely risk-neutral);8second, your “prior” beliefs
8An aside is in order. In corporate ﬁnance, the present value of a projected random payout
is the discounted expected cash ﬂow. The discounting is done at a rate that incorporates risk
(e.g., using the CAPM), and the expectation is a mathematical one using real world probabilities
(Brealey and Myers [1991]). An alternative to the real world expected cash ﬂow coupled with
the risk-adjusted discount rate is a risk-neutral world expected cash ﬂow coupled with a riskless
discount rate. The former is popular in corporate ﬁnance; the latter is popular in option pricing
(see Arnold and Crack [2004] and Arnold, Crack and Schwartz [2009, 2010]). With no discounting
(e.g., the envelope question), value is expected payoﬀ only if you are risk-neutral.

problem is a function of your individual risk preferences and is diﬃcult to
address. The second problem can be tackled using two approaches: the ﬁrst
approach is to reconsider the nature of your prior; the second approach is to
“update” your prior probability assessment (this is “Bayesian” statistics as
opposed to “classical” statistics).
The ﬁrst approach is to reconsider the nature of your priors. Our previous
(paradoxical) calculation yielded $1 .25Xas the expected payoﬀ to switching.
However, this assumes that for any given X, it is equally likely that your
opponent has $2 Xor $1
2X.I f y o u d o n o t p e e k , t h e n y o u a r e a s s u m i n g a
“diﬀuse level prior” because you assume this equality of likelihood for any
X. Your prior is, therefore, not a valid pdf because the probabilities—across
X—do not sum to 1.H o w e v e r , f o r a n y particular m,i ti se q u a l l yl i k e l yt h a t
you received one of $ mor $2 m.T h u s , f o r a n y p a r t i c u l a r m, your priors are
ap d fa n da n yp a r a d o x e ss h o u l dd i s a p p e a r . T h ee x p e c t e dv a l u eo fs w i t c h i n g
should be zero. This is easily demonstrated. Let P($m)d e n o t et h ep r o b a b i l i t y
that yougot $ m(the lower amount); let E(V) denote the expected value to
switching; then E(V)i sg i v e nb y
E(V)=[ E(V|$m)×P($m)] + [ E(V|$2m)×P($2m)]
=/p⎬renleft⎭igg
+$m×1
2/p⎬renright⎭igg
+/p⎬renleft⎭igg
−$m×1
2/p⎬renright⎭igg
=$ 0 .
The expected value is zero, and you are thus indiﬀerent—resolving the para-
dox.9Note that E(V|$m)=+ $ mbecause, conditional on your having been
given the envelope containing only $ m, you gain $ mby switching.
The second approach is to update your prior. To update your prior, you
need information. The most obvious source of information is to peek into
your envelope. So, assume that both you and your opponent peek into your
envelopes. Now it gets subjective. If you see an amount that seems very high,
then you update your prior probabilities: the probability that you have the
high-value envelope increases, and the probability that you have the low-value
envelope decreases. You no longer see value in switching envelopes.10If you
see an amount that seems very low, then you see value in switching. The
problem now is that you must subjectively assess the amount in the envelope
as being either “low” or “high.” The “Bayesian Resolution of the Exchange
Paradox” is covered in detail in Christensen and Utts (1992).
If you have both peeked, and you do switch, then you will not switch again.
This is because one of you gained, and that person will not want to lose by
9I thank Andres Almazan for suggesting this type of solution technique; any errors are mine.
10However, you might argue that if you see an amount that seems so high that even one-half of
it is more money than you can comprehend, you might switch envelopes just for the hell of it; it is
worth the gamble.

possible) appears in Dixit and Nalebuﬀ (1991, Chapter 13). The Dixit and
Nalebuﬀ book on strategic thinking is well worth a look.
Answer 4.11: This is a very common question and has been in use since at least
1990. Well, the ﬁrst thing to notice is that you are trying to replicate a $100
bet on Team A to win the series and you are doing this via a series of small
bets. At each step, there are two possible outcomes: Team A wins, or Team A
loses. With replication, time steps, and binomial outcomes, the obvious thing
to do is build a lattice for a replicating strategy (see Figure D.1). To deduce
the betting strategy in Figure D.1, I ﬁrst drew the lattice and identiﬁed the
boundary nodes at which the game must end (marked with large dots). You
start with $100 in wealth. In the case where Team A has won four games,
you must end up with an accumulated wealth of $200 through $100 in betting
proﬁts; In the case where Team B has won four games, you must end up with
an accumulated wealth of $0 through $100 in betting losses. It is simple to
step back from each pair of ending nodes (starting with the right-most pair)
to deduce how much you must bet in each case (working back to $31.25 on
the ﬁrst game) in order to end up replicating the payoﬀs at the boundary. If
you follow this betting strategy, you are guaranteed to replicate the payoﬀ to
betting $100 on Team A to win the series. The given probabilities are “red
herrings” because you do not need any probabilities, physical world or risk-
neutral, to solve this problem. Note, ﬁnally, that I have assumed that you
earn no interest on your wealth.
Answer 4.12: There are many diﬀerent possible answers; I give only two. Toss
the coin twice. If you get HT,g i v et h ea p p l et ot h eﬁ r s tc h i l d .I fy o ug e t TH,
give the apple to the second child. If you get HH,g i v et h ea p p l et ot h et h i r d
child. If you get TT, then start again. This eﬀectively takes TTout of the
sample space.
As e c o n ds o l u t i o ni st ot o s st h ec o i nt h r e et i m e sa n da s s i g nt h eo u t c o m e st ot h e
three children. Let Twin. If one child beats the other two (i.e., the outcome
is some permutation of {T,H,H }), then give the apple to the child who was
allocated the T. Otherwise, toss three more times. This is isomorphic to a
tournament where each child competes against each other child until one child
beats both others.

take more than 2 tosses to complete the strategy. We can use a recursion to
ﬁnd the expected number of tosses. Let Nbe the number of tosses required,
then there is a three quarter chance that Nwill be 2, but a one-quarter chance
that you have to start again (in the TToutcome). Thus E(N)=/⎭r⎬cketleft⎜ig

From my second answer in Answer 4.12: We will need at least three tosses in
this case, but there are ﬁve chances in eight that we will need more than three
tosses. Using a recursive argument similar to that above, we ﬁgure that the
expected number of tosses in this case is E(N)=8 .
Answer 4.14: To simulate an event with probability 1/3 using a fair coin, toss
the coin twice. If you get HH,l e tt h a tb ey o u re v e n tw i t hp r o b a b i l i t y1 / 3 .
If you get HTorTH, let that be your event with probability 2/3. If you get
TT, then ignore it, and toss twice again. By removing TTfrom the sample
space, the outcomes are restricted to three equally likely possibilities.
Answer 4.15: Start with a simple case ﬁrst: What if you only need the expected
number of tosses required to get onehead? Let Nbe the number of coin
tosses, then we want to ﬁnd E(N|1H) (expected number of tosses given that
you seek only one head). Toss the coin once. Either you get a head (with
probability p)o ry o ug e tat a i l .I fy o ug e tat a i l ,t h e ny o ua r er e c u r s i v e l yb a c k
where you started. That is, there is probability pthat N=1 ,a n dp r o b a b i l i t y
1−pthat you still have E(N|1H)t o s s e st og oa f t e rt h eo n ey o ua l r e a d yt o s s e d .
In other words,
E(N|1H)=( p·1) + (1 −p)·[1 +E(N|1H)].
Solving for E(N|1H)g i v e s E(N|1H)=1
p.C h e c k :t h eh i g h e ri s p,t h el o w e ri s
E(N|1H), and when p=0.50 (a fair coin), E(N|1H) = 2, all of which seems
reasonable.
Now consider the case of two heads in a row. Well, to get two heads in a
row, you ﬁrst need one head “in a row,” which requires the expected1
ptosses
just calculated. If you have this one head already, then there is probability
pthat your next toss will be a head, and probability (1 −p)t h a ty o ua r e
back where you started having performed E(N|1H)p l u so n et o s s e sa l r e a d y .
In other words,
E(N|2H)= p·[E(N|1H)+1 ]+( 1 −p)·[E(N|1H)+1+ E(N|2H)]
=E(N|1H)+1+( 1 −p)·E(N|2H).
This last line implies that
E(N|2H)=E(N|1H)+1

In the case of a fair coin, this gives E(N|2H)=6 . E x a c t l yt h es a m er e a s o n i n g

This can be proved formally using numerical induction if you wish.
Answer 4.16: When repeatedly tossing a fair coin, what is the probability that
you will see the sequence HTH before you see the sequence HHT ?
At ﬁrst blush, you might say that with a fair coin and equally likely outcomes,
and independent tosses, any of the eight possible triplets is as likely as any
other, and so the answer is 50%. Although any triplet is equally likely in three
tosses, it does not necessarily follow that you are equally likely to see any one
triplet before another in repeated tosses. This is because one outcome can
prevent another outcome.
For example, suppose we had been asked how likely it is that we will see
triplet HHH before triplet THH .I nt h i sc a s e ,t h eo n l yw a yt h a ty o uw i l ls e e
HHH before THH ,i si ft h eﬁ r s tt h r e et o s s e sa r eh e a d s ,w h i c hh a p p e n sw i t h
probability one eighth. If you see anything other than three heads in the ﬁrst
three tosses, then THH must occur before HHH .T h i si sb e c a u s ee a c ho ft h e
other seven triplets includes a T, and once you have seen a T, you only need
to see the ﬁrst two Hso fHHH to see THH . So, seeing a Tprevents you
from seeing HHH before THH .
For the case in hand, how likely are you to see HTH before HHT ? Well, both
triplets need an Hto get started. So, we can completely ignore any outcome
until we get an H. For this reason, my tree in Figure D.2 starts with an H.
Now the argument is quite simple. If there is a second H(i.e., the upper
branch of the ﬁrst fork), then HHT must “win” (i.e., occur ﬁrst) eventually.
The only way that HHT would not win is if there were an inﬁnite sequence
ofHs—which happens with probability zero.
If the ﬁrst His followed by a T(i.e., the lower branch of the ﬁrst fork in
Figure D.2), then either the next toss is an H,a n d HTH wins, or the next
toss is a T,a n dw er e s t a r tt h eg a m e .
Given that the lower branch of the second fork restarts the game, we can
treat this outcome as if it is not in the sample space at all. This is perfectly
analogous to Answer 4.12, where we tossed a coin twice to give an apple to
one of three children with equal probability, but we restarted the game if TT
occurred.

Figure D.2: Coin Toss Triplets: HTH versus HHT

probability zero). Two Tsi nar o wr e s t a r t st h eg a m e .

Answer 4.17: When tossing a fair coin, the number of tosses, N, needed to
obtain the outcome HTH is a random variable. What is E(N)? This question
diﬀers from the previous question in two ways. First, we are counting tosses
here, rather than focusing solely on probability of outcomes. So, we need to
count the tosses needed to get that ﬁrst Hin this case. Second, there is no
competition between triplets vying for their ﬁrst appearance. So, no outcome
prevents us from eventually getting HTH .
In Figure D.3 I have repeated the tree from Figure D.2, but I have added the
earlier fork needed to get the ﬁrst H. We now look at Figure D.3 and use
ar e c u r s i v ea r g u m e n tt w i c e . W i t h Nas the number of tosses needed to get
HTH ,w el o o ka tp r o b a b i l i s t i co u t c o m e so nt h eﬁ r s tf o r ko ft h et r e e . I fw e
toss a Tﬁrst, then we have burned one toss, and we restart again with E(N)
additional tosses expected. So, an initial Toutcome gives a half a chance that
we take [1 + E(N)] tosses. If, instead, we toss an initial H,t h e nw eh a v e
burned one toss, and we now need to ask what is E(X|H), where X|His the
count of ex tra tosses required conditional upon having obtained the initial H.
12More formally, we are rescaling the probabilities in the tree by dividing them through by
P(¬HTT )=3 / 4 . S o ,f o re x a m p l e , P(HHT |¬HTT )=P(HHT ∩¬HTT )

Note: HTH start with an H.A n i n i t i a l Trestarts the game. A

So, an initial Houtcome gives a half a chance that we take [1 + E(X|H)]
tosses. Thus, we have Equation D.6

and are back to where we were with an additional E(X|H) tosses required.
Multiplying probabilities down the lower branch of the second fork with the
branches of the third fork, we see there is one quarter of a chance that we use
two extra tosses and the game is over, and one quarter of a chance that we
burn two extra tosses and are back to the start with E(N)t o s s e sl e f t . P u t t i n g

Answer 4.18: This is elementary statistics, and one of the easiest questions in
this book. The rules of the game have eﬀectively removed the 1 from the
sample space (i.e., the collection of possible outcomes). It follows that there
are ﬁve possible outcomes (2 to 6), and each is equally likely. The expected
outcome is simply/summ⎬tiontexti=6

5=$ 4.
To do the sum in your head, remember that the dots on the opposing faces of
the die add to seven. The sum must be three times seven, less one to give 20.
Now divide by ﬁve to get the expected payoﬀ of $4.
Answer 4.19: The naive answer is that the probability is just2
52≈4%. This
is incorrect. There are four chances that the ﬁrst card dealt to you (out of a
deck of 52) is a King. Conditional on the ﬁrst card being a King, there are
three chances that the second card dealt to you (out of the remaining deck of
51) is a King. Conditional probability says that
P(Both are Kings) =
P(Second is a King |First is a King) ×P(First is a King)
where “ |”i sr e a da s“ c o n d i t i o n a lu p o n , ”o r“ g i v e n . ”T h i si sas p e c i a lc a s eo f

independent. That is, you calculate the probability that the second card is a
King given that, or dependent upon , the ﬁrst card being a King.
I wish to emphasize that the above procedure is diﬀerent from that for ﬁguring
out the probability that, for example, you get two heads in two tosses of a fair
coin (this probability is1
2×1
2=1
4). The outcomes of the coin tosses are
genuinely independent , and this is why you can multiply their probabilities
directly. That is, P(H1∩H2)=P(H2|H1)×P(H1)=P(H2)×P(H1) because
the probability of a head on the second coin toss is not inﬂuenced by the event
that you get a head on the ﬁrst coin toss (i.e., the conditional probability
formula still applies but it reduces to the product of probabilities if the events
are independent). However, the probability that you get a King on the second
card dealt isinﬂuenced by the event that you get a King on the ﬁrst card
dealt. That is why the conditional probability theory is used. Be sure you
understand the distinction and how and where to apply each method. If it is
not clear, go to your favorite statistics book for a review (e.g., see Feller [1968,
Chapter V]).
Answer 4.20: The “Let’s Make a Deal” or “Monty Hall” problem is very fre-
quently asked. Many people ﬁnd it very diﬃcult.
Assume that you choose Door 3. The host opens Door 2 and oﬀers you the
chance to switch to Door 1. Should you do it? If you have decided that it
does not matter whether you switch doors or not (indiﬀerence), or that you
should deﬁnitely not switch (aversion), then you should go back and think
again before reading any further. Stop here and try again.
Let me begin with very simple intuition. My experience, however, is that
many readers cannot accept the simple intuition, and for them I provide a
formal proof using Bayes’ Theorem.
SIMPLE INT UIT ION
Assume for a moment that you have already decided that you will switch
doors. What then is the probability that you will ﬁnd the prize behind the
door you switch to? Well, you win the prize if you originally chose one of the
two doors that has nothing behind it. In that case, the host shows you the
other empty door, and switching yields the prize. So, the problem reduces to
ﬁguring the probability that you originally chose one of the two doors that
has nothing behind it. That unconditional probability is just two thirds by
construction. You thus have probability two thirds that you win by switching
and one third that you lose by switching. So, you should switch!14

If you are to play this game repeatedly, two-thirds of the time you proﬁt by
switching, and one-third of the time you lose by switching. Let Bkdenote the

the event that you see the host open Door number j(“H”f o rh ost).
The unconditional probabilities of the location of prizes (probabilities calcu-
lated without conditioning on which door the host opens) are simply P(B1)=
P(B2)=P(B3)=1
3.W h a t y o u n e e d t o k n o w i s t h e c o n d i t i o n a l p r o b a b i l i t y
P(B1|H2). That is, the probability that the prize is behind Door 1 given that
you see (or “conditional on”) the host open Door 2. We use a straightforward
application of conditional expectations and Bayes’ Theorem (see Feller [1968,
Chapter V]), as follows:
P(B1|H2)=P(B1∩H2)
P(H2)=P(H2∩B1)
P(H2)=P(H2|B1)×P(B1)
P(H2)
You know that P(B1)=1
3,b u tw h a ta b o u t P(H2|B1)a n d P(H2)? You know
that the host is going to show you an empty door other than the door you
choose (assume through all of this that it is Door 3 that you choose). The
host’s door must be revealed empty and cannot be the same door that you
choose. Therefore, it must be that if you choose Door 3, then P(H2|B1)=1 .
Now, P(H2)i sg i v e nb y
P(H2)=[ P(H2|B1)×P(B1)] + [ P(H2|B2)×P(B2)]
+[P(H2|B3)×P(B3)],
so some extra terms need to be calculated to get P(H2).
Well, the host’s door must be shown to be empty, so it must be that P(H2|B2)=
0. The host is impartial, so it must be that P(H2|B3)=1
2[and P(H1|B3)=1
2].
Thus, P(H2)i sg i v e nb y
P(H2)=[ P(H2|B1)×P(B1)] + [ P(H2|B2)×P(B2)]
+[P(H2|B3)×P(B3)]

The summary in Table D.6 may clarify matters further. You choose Door 3.
The host must choose an empty door to open. If the prize is behind Door 1,
hemust open Door 2 [ P(H2|B1) = 1]. However, if the prize is behind Door 3,
he can choose between Doors 1 and 2 [ P(H2|B3)=1
2]. If you see Door 2, it
is either because the prize is behind Door 1, and the host had no choice, or it
is because the prize is behind Door 3, and the host randomly chose between
Doors 1 and 2. It, therefore, follows that if you choose Door 3, and Door 2 is

revealed empty by the host, the prize is twice as likely to be behind Door 1 as
it is to be behind Door 3. Continuing along this line of thought, we may take
af r e q u e n t i s ta p p r o a c h . S u p p o s ey o up l a yt h eg a m er e p e a t e d l ya n da l w a y s
choose Door 3. If you look at all the times the host reveals Door 2 empty, you
will ﬁnd that two-thirds of the time the prize lies behind Door 1, and one-third
of the time it is behind Door 3. Seeing Door 2 empty is thus a stronger signal
that Door 1 has the prize than it is that Door 3 has it. This argument is
more general, of course. Whichever door you choose, seeing the host reveal an
empty door is a signal that you should switch.
Answer 4.21: There are two interpretations. If we assume that the game can
be played repeatedly with an audience member always revealing a door to
be empty, then we must also assume that the audience member knows the
location of the prize. Otherwise, how can he or she always reveal an empty
door in repeated play? In this case, if we make the same uniformly random
assumptions about prize placement and empty doors revealed as in the previ-
ous question, then the audience member is, in eﬀect, wearing the host’s hat,
and the argument is the same as in the previous question: You should always
switch.
Suppose instead that the host of this week’s show has, just for a one-oﬀ special
occasion (his 60th birthday, say), decided to let an audience member (who is
ignorant of the prize’s location) reveal another door. Suppose it just happens
to turn out to be empty. We cannot now talk about a frequentist approach and
repeated plays of the game because in repeated plays, the audience member
would reveal the prize one third of the time, and that is not the situation
we ﬁnd ourselves in. The ignorant audience member has, on this occasion,
just happened to show us an empty door. The audience member has blindly
removed one door from the sample space, and we have a 50/50 chance of
winning (and also of losing) if we switch. We are therefore indiﬀerent.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 308 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAnswer 4.22: This question is solved most eﬃciently by trying a few possible
combinations, not by some time-consuming feat of constrained linear opti-

Answer 4.23: This is a tough “game theory” problem. Early editions of my
book included a full and formal solution to this problem. It was more than
ﬁve pages long and far too detailed. I have now cut my answer down to bare
bones key issues only.15
Mr. 30 and Mr. 60 are going to shoot at each other because they do not see
you as an immediate threat; you do not die ﬁrst because Mr. 60 and Mr. 30
are shooting it out; you do not want to be put into a shoot-out where your
opponent is a very good shot and gets to shoot ﬁrst; if Mr. 30 gets to shoot
before Mr. 60, it is less likely that you end up facing Mr. 60 than if Mr. 60
gets to shoot ﬁrst, so you shoot in the air; if the direction of play is reversed,
and Mr. 60 gets to shoot before Mr. 30, then you should help out Mr. 30 (and
yourself) by shooting at Mr. 60 also, otherwise, leave it to Mr. 30; the cost
of stepping in and shooting at Mr. 60 is that if you hit Mr. 60, you lose your
chance to shoot ﬁrst in the ﬁnal shootout with Mr. 30; the beneﬁt of stepping
in and shooting at Mr. 60 is that you increase the likelihood of your facing
Mr. 30 rather than Mr. 60 in the ﬁnal shoot-out; there is a delicate balance
between leaving it to Mr. 30 and stepping in to help him out, and it changes
with the direction of play. Finally, there is a slim chance that everyone shoots
at the sky, but this requires some sort of cooperation.
Answer 4.24: If you take the three-point shot, you have a 40% chance of winning.
If you take the two-point shot, you have a 70% chance of a tie, and conditional
on a tie you have a 50% chance of winning in overtime. Informally, the proba-
bility of winning if you take the two-point shot is thus 70% multiplied by 50%,
which is 35%. This is lower than for the 40% for the three-point shot, so you
should take the three-pointer.
More formally, let “ W”d e n o t ew inning, let “2” denote taking the two-point
shot, let “ T”d e n o t es i n k i n gt h et w o - p o i n t e ra n dg e t t i n gat ie, and let “ TC”

denote missing the two-pointer and not getting the tie (the “ C” is for comple-
ment, that is, the remainder of the sample space). Then

=( 0 .50×0.70) + (0 ×0.30)

Answer 4.25: This is one of the easier problems. If the cost is $1.50 per spin, and
you may play as often as you want, then yes, you should play. The expected
payoﬀ is $1.80 per spin (/summ⎬tiontexti=5
i=1Payoﬀi×1
5=$ 1.80). If you can play as often as
you want, you are risk-neutral (in the long run, your average payoﬀ will equal
the expected payoﬀ), and you expect to make $0.30 per spin on average.
If you get only one spin, then whether you play or not depends upon whether
the expected $0.30 gain is suﬃcient to compensate you for the risk of losing
$0.50 (the $1.50 cost less the $1.00 worst possible payoﬀ). With amounts
this small, you would probably take the bet. It is like spending $1.50 on a
lottery ticket—it is too small to care about. If the numbers were larger, say
everything multiplied by one billion, and if your job is lost if you lose, then
you are signiﬁcantly more risk-averse, and your boss would not want you to
take the bet.
Answer 4.26: Assuming no special information on your part, each sports match
presents a ﬁfty-ﬁfty chance of winning. Assuming each match is independent
of each other, then winning is analogous to tossing a fair coin four times in

odds of winning are thus much worse than the odds oﬀered by the bookie, and
you should not play unless you are a risk-seeker. If the odds were raised to
25-to-1, this would be an attractive bet.
Answer 4.27: This is a simple question, but, strictly speaking, it is not well
posed. You cannot ask for “the standard deviation of (1 ,2,3,4,5)” without
supplying further information. You should ask the interviewer which of the
following cases he or she means. The ﬁrst solution assumes we have drawn a
sample and we are estimating the population parameter. The second solution
assumes we are dealing with the full sample space and we are calculating the
true population parameter.
FIRST SOLUT ION
Perhaps the interviewer wants the standard deviation of these numbers assum-
ing they are a sample drawn from some data generating process. In that case,
we need to know whether they are sampled independently of each other and
whether the process is stable. If not, the answer can be quite diﬃcult. So, let
us assume that the observations are independent and identically distributed.
We can ﬁnd the sample standard deviation with and without a small sample
adjustment.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 310 All Rights Reserved WorldwideThe sample standard deviation without adjustment is just the square root of
the average of the sum of squared deviations from the mean. The mean is 3.

If we use the small sample adjustment,16where we divide by N−1, we instead

2.5.
SECOND SOLUT ION
Perhaps the interviewer wants us to assume that (1 ,2,3,4,5) is the full sample
space of possible outcomes for a random variable, and that each is equally
likely. That is, a uniform discrete distribution from 1 to 5. In that case, the
standard deviation is just the square root of the expected squared deviation
from the mean, with the outcomes weighted by true probabilities.
The mean of (1 ,2,3,4,5) is 3. The squared deviations are 4, 1, 0, 1, 4,
each with probability1
5. The expected squared deviation is 2. The standard
deviation is thus√

Answer 4.28: Given that no shot was ﬁred on the ﬁrst pull of the trigger, there
are four possible states of the world corresponding to where the ﬁring pin

(i.e., there is only one chance in four of not having to discuss your CV). If I

are in play, and the odds of you being killed increase to one in three. So, you
do not want me to spin it.
Another way to look at this is that on the ﬁrst pull of the trigger, the ﬁring pin
did not strike the ﬁrstof the two contiguous rounds. Assuming no spin of the
cylinder, then on the second pull of the trigger, the ﬁring pin will not strike
thesecond of the two contiguous rounds. After a spin the cylinder, however,
both rounds are in play, yielding a higher probability of death for you.
Answer 4.29: Before we look at the formal math, let’s use some informal intu-
ition. There is one chance in a thousand (unconditionally) that you plucked
the two-headed coin (which would certainly explain 10 heads in a row). There
is also about one chance in a thousand that a fair coin would give 10 heads
in a row (because/p⎬renleft⎜ig
1
2/p⎬renright⎜ig10=1
1024≈1
1000). Looking at the event (10 heads), I’d
have to say that the coin is roughly equally likely to be two-headed or fair.
Now turn to the formal math – a direct application of Bayes’ Theorem. Let
“TH”d e n o t et h ee v e n tt h a ty o u rc o i ni st h et w o - h e a d e do n e . L e t“ 1 0 H”

denote the complement of an event X.T h e n

heads, you have about a half a chance that you have the two-headed coin—as
per our intuition.
Answer 4.30: You win with probability 1 /3. Wind is eﬀectively absent from the

of even getting to turn a second card. If you do get to turn the second card,
there is 50% chance that it will be Fire and you lose, and a 50% chance it will
not be, and you win. Thus the probability of winning is 50% of 2 /3.
Alternatively,17of the three cards that matter, you win if Fire is the last card
selected. The probability that one card out of nis the last selected in a random
sequence is 1/ n, which is 1/3 in this case.

bias in a coin. The probability of a probability is a “second-order probability”

is true). With N=1,000, µ(p)= Np=7 5 0a n d σ(p)=/r⎬dic⎬l⎭ig
Np(1−p)=√
1000 ·0.75·0.25 =√
187.5≈13.7. So, the values of fN(µ(p),σ(p))(x)t h a t
matter would be bounded by roughly 750 ±35. If we squint, we get the
normal pdf taking signiﬁcant values for 715 ≤x≤785, say. Now, in fact, it
isx= 750 that is ﬁxed, and the integral in Equation D.10 is over p,n o t x.
20This conclusion relies upon a Weak Law of Large Numbers argument (see Footnote 1 [on p. 292],
and DeGroot [1989, p. 229–231]).
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 314 All Rights Reserved WorldwideEven so, for large N, varying pwith ﬁxed x,a n da s k i n gh o wf a r Npis from

Np(and the variation in σ(p)i sn o te n o u g ht om a k em u c ho fad i ﬀ e r e n c e ) .
We conclude, therefore, that the conditional cdf of ˜Plooks much like a step
function, but instead of a sudden step up at p=0.75, there is a sloped step
from something like p=0.715 to something like p=0.785. The larger is N
(assuming x=0.75N), the steeper would be the step.21
Answer 4.33: This is well known. More generally, if X∼N(µ, σ2), then E(eX)=
eµ+1
2σ2.IfXis normal, then eXis lognormal. So, this is the sort of knowl-
edge that arises in analytical Black-Scholes derivatives work, or in setting up
a Monte-Carlo simulation of price paths in a Black-Scholes world. See Crack
(2021, Section 2.2) for detailed discussion and examples. It is straightforward
to prove this from ﬁrst principles because the normal pdf has an e(·)kernel in
it, and you just have to add the exponents, complete the square, and integrate
out to see what is left over.
Answer 4.34: Both games have the same expected payoﬀ: $3.5 million. However,
the second game has much less volatility than the ﬁrst. The Weak Law of Large
Numbers says that your actual payoﬀ will be much closer to the expected payoﬀ
in Game Two. As a risk-averse individual, you choose Game Two.

F(P|750H/1000)(0.785) ≈0.9967. For N= 100 ,000 (and x= 75 ,000), the same values are achieved

where “ * ” follows because the variance of the sum equals the sum of the
variance when the random variables are independent, and “ ** ” follows di-
rectly from the deﬁnition of Xiusing the deﬁnition of variance as probability-
weighted deviation about the mean: V(Xi)=( 1 −p)2·p+p2·(1−p)=p(1−p).
it follows that the standard error of Y/ N is the square root of its variance:
SE(Y/ N)=/r⎬dic⎬l⎜ig
p(1−p)
N.
In the particular case of the question we have ˆ p=0.60, so our best guess for
the standard error is/r⎬dic⎬l⎜ig
ˆp(1−ˆp)
N=/r⎬dic⎬l⎜ig
0.60·0.40

ˆp(1−ˆp)
N=0.60±1.96·0.01549 = 0 .60±0.0304.
That is, the margin of error is roughly plus/minus 3%, which is what I said
two-dozen lines above! So, how did I know that before working out the details?
The key lies in two approximations. First, the 95% conﬁdence interval for ˆ p
is ˆp±1.96 times the standard error, so let us just take that as ±2.00 times
the standard error. Now, the standard error itself is/r⎬dic⎬l⎜ig
p(1−p)
N,b u tf o rm o s t
cases of interest, pis roughly 0.50 (otherwise it would not be much of a horse
race). So, p(1−p) is roughly 0.25. In fact, p(1−p)i sa ni n v e r t e dp a r a b o l ai n
pand it has slope zero at p=0.50. So, there is a range about p=0.50 where
approximating p(1−p) by 0.25 is good. For example, with ˆ p=0.60 we get
ˆp(1−ˆp)=0 .24 which is very close.
So, we get a conﬁdence interval which is
ˆp±(roughly 2) ×/r⎬dic⎬l⎜igg
roughly 0.25
N,
but√
0.25 = 0 .50, and 2 times this gives 1. So, we get a 95% conﬁdence
interval which is roughly
ˆp±/r⎬dic⎬l⎭igg1
N.
This is a good approximation unless ˆ pis quite far from 0.50.
It is good if you can calculate approximate square roots of powers of 10 in
your head:√1,000≈30,√10,000 = 100,√100,000≈300, and so on. ...and
you need to be able to invert them too (e.g., 1 /30≈0.03).
Answer 4.36: This is an old/common interview question. It is a direct applica-
tion of Bayes’ Theorem. Question 4.29 was also a Bayes’ Theorem question.
In that case we tried some informal intuition before doing the math; let us try
that here too.
Most people do not have the disease. If we were to randomly select from the
disease-free population (which is 99.5% of the sample here, so that is not too
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 316 All Rights Reserved Worldwidefar from what we are actually doing), we would get a positive test result 7%
of the time. If we are randomly selecting from the entire population, we get a
diseased person 0.5% of the time. So, overall it seems that for roughly 7.5% of
the draws, we get a positive, but for only 0.5% of the draws would they have
the disease. Given a positive test result, we focus only on the roughly 7.5%
of the population that returns a positive. With this restriction, the likelihood
of the person having the disease is the ratio of those with the disease to those
with a positive: roughly 0 .005/0.075. This ratio is just 2 /3w i t ht h ed e c i m a l
place moved, so our guess is 6.67%.
Now let us do the math. Let “+” denote a positive on the test. Let “ D”
denote the presence of the disease, and let “ Dc”d e n o t et h ec o m p l e m e n to f
being diseased (i.e., no disease). Then from Bayes’ Theorem
P(D|+) =P(D∩+)
P(+)
=P(+|D)P(D)
P(+|D)P(D)+P(+|Dc)P(Dc)
=(1×0.005)
(1×0.005) + (0 .07×0.995)
≈0.005
0.07465
≈0.06698 .
So, our 6.67% estimate is not far oﬀ.
If the percentage with the disease were only 0.05%, then the answer would drop
to 0.007096% (which is almost exactly the ratio of P(D)t o[P(+|Dc)+P(D)]—
the dominant terms in the above calculations).

A less elegant approach is to consider 20 independent generalized Bernoulli

a 1 in the position corresponding to the die’s outcome and zeroes otherwise.
The ﬁve-tuple containing the cumulative total count of outcomes is distributed
multinomial (DeGroot [1989, p. 297]). The number of possible fungible (i.e., ﬁ-

Story: I spoke with a gay employee at a big-name Wall Street investment

and wear their wedding rings. ”
Answer 4.38: The nature of the problem allows us to practice many diﬀerent
skills: statistical inference, probability, combinatorics, recursion, induction,
algebraic approximations, etc.
This question is a particular case of a more general question: How many chips,
N, should go randomly into some cookie dough to give a probability of at least
pthat each of kcookies randomly cut from the batch contains at least mchips?
The interviewer’s particular case uses the high probability p=0.90 and the
low hurdle m=1c h i p sp e rc o o k i e .
Well, if you have fewer than 100 chips, then at least one cookie does not have

initial gut instinct guess before any formal analysis. My gut instinct is that
something like N= 500 chips is enough because I would then be fairly sure
that each cookie in the batch gets a chip. Is 500 enough? We will look at two
exact solutions and several approximations to ﬁnd out.

to ﬁgure out the probability of getting a particular sub-batch of ichip-less

#2: Recursion.25An exact solution can also be found using a recursion
approach. Let Bk,Ncount the number of ways that we can put Nchips into
kcookies. There are kchoices for the ﬁrst chip, kchoices for the second chip,
etc. So, Bk,N=kN.L e t Ck,Ncount the number of ways that we can put
Nchips into kcookies where every cookie gets at least one chip (call this
outcome a “success”). Well, as mentioned above, Ck,N=0i f N<k .W e m u s t
also have C1,N=1f o ra l l N≥1 (there is only one way to place Nchips into
one cookie). We can get a recursion going as follows: In order to get a success
when placing the Nthchip, it must be either that the previous N−1c h i p s
already distributed a chip to each cookie (success already!) and the Nthchip
can go into any of the kcookies, or the previous N−1c h i p sd i s t r i b u t e dac h i p

Answer 4.40: I ﬁrst heard about the “broken stick problem” appearing in MBA
interviews back in the early 1990’s. It is still used today. This classic question
deserves justice here.
Let me present two solutions for obtaining the probability that a triangle can
be formed from three bits. The ﬁrst solution is based on a general proof using
polygons and polytopes due to Bull (1948) and I shall draw upon that solution
to answer the next question. The second solution is much shorter and is an
expansion of an equivalent argument using just a circle (Rushton, 1949).
FIRST SOLUT ION
Bull (1948) considers the case where a stick is broken randomly into npieces.
He says that a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a polygon of nor fewer
angles to be made out of the npieces is that no one piece can be of a length
that exceeds the sum of the lengths of the others. Equivalently, each piece
must be not greater in length than half the length of the stick.30
Following Bull... ...let x,y,a n d1 −x−ydenote the lengths of the three
separate pieces formed from a stick of unit length. If xandyare taken as axes
of coordinates in two dimensions, then all ways of breaking the stick (regardless
of whether a triangle can be formed or not) are represented by points inside
and on the triangle formed by the coordinate axes and the line x+y=1
(i.e., the boundary and interior of the triangle O–A1–A2in Figure D.5). If
this statement is not immediately obvious, then think of it as follows. There
28It h a n kS i m o nW e s tf o rs u g g e s t i n gt h i st e c h n i q u e ;a n ye r r o r sa r em i n e .
29Alternatively, we may use the geometric distribution, as we did in Answers 4.1 and 4.13, with
p=1 / 2 ,t oﬁ n d E(N+1) = 1/ p= 2. I thank Mark Cawston for discussions regarding this answer;
any errors are mine.
30Bull implicitly allows for two degenerate cases: triangles with zero area when one piece has
length1
2; and, one or two pieces having zero length. For randomly placed breaks, these cases
happen with probability zero; my allowing them does not change the ﬁnal answer.

each piece has non-negative length: x≥0,y≥0, and 1 −x−y≥0. After
rearranging the latter inequality, these three conditions say x≥0,y≥0, and
x+y≤1. The intersection of these three conditions is the boundary and
interior of the triangle O–A1–A2in Figure D.5, as stated.
The points in Figure D.5 representing ways of breaking the stick that allow a
triangle to be formed are those points inside and on the area bounded by the

Visual inspection of Figure D.5 yields the same solution, solving the question.
Bull (1948) presents a geometric proof for the case of four pieces. His proof is
the three-dimensional analogy of my Figure D.5. He has three axes, x,y,z,
and a tetrahedron representing all ways of forming a polygon of four or fewer
angles from the pieces. At the origin, and along each axis are tetrahedrons
that must be excluded if a polygon is to be formed. So, instead of my two axes
and three triangles to exclude, Bull has three axes and four tetrahedrons to
exclude. I won’t draw the picture, but here are the calculations: The volume
of a tetrahedron is1

SECOND SOLUT ION
Rushton (1949) gives a very elegant re-statement of the n-segment problem in
terms of placing points at random on the circumference of a circle.32Assume
that we sprinkle npoints randomly upon the circumference of a circle. Label
these points as X1,X2,. . . , Xn. Now cut the circle at point Xn,o p e ni tu p ,
and ﬂatten it out to a straight line. Label the end that was adjacent to Xnas
O.T h e r ea r e nline segments: O–X1,X1–X2,. . . ,Xn−1–Xn.
Let us solve for the likelihood that we cannot form an n-sided polygon from
these segments. We cannot form the polygon if there exists a line segment
longer than half the length of O–Xn.E a c h s e g m e n t i s e q u a l l y l i k e l y t o b e

Unlike Answer 4.40, a triangle need not be formed here. To derive the pdf for
the longest piece we will derive the cdf ﬁrst and then diﬀerentiate it. We shall
work with the properties of Figure D.5.
LetLdenote the random longest piece, and ldenote a particular value of L.
We want to ﬁnd the cdf FL(l)=P(L≤l).We know that L≡max( x, y,1−

Answer 4.46: To obtain three heads or three tails, the coin must be tossed a
minimum of three times. At most ﬁve tosses are required, because it is impos-
sible to toss the coin ﬁve times without obtaining three matching outcomes.
So, the game will stop after either three, four, or ﬁve tosses.

Answer 4.47: A bias towards either heads or tails in the coin in Question 4.46
is a bias in favor of “more of the same.” Given that the stopping rule is “three
of the same,” the expected number of tosses required to end the game must
decrease in this case.
So, if the probability of a head is one-half, and Tis the number of tosses
required to end the game, E(T)=41
8, and it cannot be higher. If, however, the
probability of a head is two-thirds (or, given symmetry, if it is one-third), the
expected number of tosses to end the game drops to E(T)=1 0 7 / 2 7 ≈3.96. If
the probability of a head is 3/4 (or, given symmetry, if it is 1/4), the expected
number of tosses to end the game drops to E(T)=4 8 3 / 1 2 8 ≈3.77. If the

It follows that E[L(5)]−E[L(4)] =5

So, we just have to add 0.0625 to 0.2500 to get 0.3125.
Answer 4.49: There are 63= 216 distinct outcomes from rolling three dice. For
the diﬀerence between the maximum and minimum outcomes of three dice
(i.e., the range) to be exactly four, you must either have a maximum of a 6
and a minimum or a 2, or a maximum or a 5 and a minimum of a 1.
Let us consider the ﬁrst case (max=6, min=2). What is the third number? It
must be a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, the unordered outcomes are 226, 236, 246, 256,
and 266. Paying attention to order, the ﬁrst can occur three ways (i.e., the
6 is ﬁrst, second, or third), the next three can be permuted in six ways each,
and the last can occur in three ways (i.e., the 2 is ﬁrst, second, or third). So,
there are 3+18+3=24 ways to obtain a range of exactly four, with a maximum
of a 6 and a minimum of a 2.
Similarly, there are 24 diﬀerent ways to obtain a range of exactly four when
the maximum is a 5 and the minimum is a 1. So, there are 48 p ossible ways,
out of 216, to obtain a range of exactly four. After some simpliﬁcations, we
see that48

Answer 4.50: The initial value P(0) = 100 is irrelevant, except that it is non-
zero. With these odds, the population will not last long at all.
LetGbe the number of generations until extinction. Then there is half a
chance that the population will be extinct in one generation, and half a chance
that it will survive for one more generation (and we then we are faced with
the same question again). So, a simple recursion says that

Answer 4.51: Given Ccoins, and the requirement that you ﬂip them in groups
ofgadjacent coins, let us assume that C≥3 (ignoring the very simple cases
C=1a n d C=2 ) . L e tu sa l s oa s s u m et h a t1 ≤g≤C.( I f g>C ,w ec a n
think of gin modulo- Cterms, looking at the coins that do get ﬂipped.)
Letgcd(C, g)d e n o t et h eg r e a t e s tc o m m o nd i v i s o ro f Candg. For example,
gcd(7,3) = 1, but gcd(12,9) = 3. Let me begin with the speciﬁc case where
gcd(C, g)=1a n d gis odd. Our particular case ( C=7,g=3 )s a t i s ﬁ e st h e s e
assumptions.
Let us number the coins from 1 to C,l i k et h en u m b e r so ft h eh o u r so na n
analog clock face with Chours. Let the coin in the middle of any group of
gcoins to be ﬂipped be our reference point (recall that we are assuming gis
odd, so a middle coin exists). There are Csuch possible reference points.
Let us pick a coin ﬂipping strategy. For any reference coin c,s a y ,w eh a v et o
choose whether to ﬂip the group centered on cor not. Note that the order
of our ﬂipping decisions is irrelevant because either two groups of coins to be
ﬂipped do not overlap, and so order is unimportant, or two groups of coins to
be ﬂipped do overlap, in which case, any coin in the overlap is ﬂipped twice,
and is left unchanged regardless of the order of the ﬂips. Note also that we
would never ﬂip any group more than once, because all that does is consume
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 336 All Rights Reserved Worldwideﬂips (which we wish to minimize), to no eﬀect. For example, if we ﬂip some
group twice, then the same strategy but excluding those two ﬂips gives the
same outcome, or if we ﬂip some group three times, that is the same as ﬂipping
once. So, let us assume all ﬂipping strategies have any such redundant ﬂips
removed.
Then, given that we have to make the decision to ﬂip, or not, any group
centered on c,f o r c=1,2,...,C ,a n dw ew i l ln o tﬂ i pa n yg r o u pm o r et h a n
once, it follows that there are exactly 2Cpossible coin ﬂipping strategies.
Suppose we ﬂip every group of gcoins. That is, when we focus on each coin,
c,f o r c=1,2,...,C , we say yes, we will ﬂip the group of coins centered on
coin c. For example, in the case C=7a n d g=3t h i sw o u l dm e a nt h a tw e
ﬂip the C=7c o i ng r o u p s( 7 , 1 , 2 ) ,( 1 , 2 , 3 ) ,( 2 , 3 , 4 ) ,( 3 , 4 , 5 ) ,( 4 , 5 , 6 ) ,( 5 , 6 , 7 ) ,a n d
(6,7,1). Then, the even distribution of the C×gindividual coin ﬂips means
that we have ﬂipped every one of the Cindividual coins gtimes. Given that
gis odd, we have ﬂipped every coin from heads-up to heads-down, which was
to be done.
Note also that, because order does not matter, the sequence of consecutively-
overlapping coin ﬂips stated above has the same outcome as this sequence of
consecutively non-overlapping coin ﬂip groups: (1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,1,2), (3,4,5),
(6,7,1), (2,3,4), and (5,6,7). This ordering of ﬂips, though equivalent, will be
easier to work with at the next step.
How can we prove that ﬂipping all Cgroups of gcoins is the minimum number
of moves needed to achieve the all-coins-turned-over outcome? Well, in the
case where gcd(C, g)=1a n d gis odd, we will prove in a moment that there
exists a strategy to achieve any possible outcome. There are 2Cpossible
outcomes, and, as argued above, 2Cstrategies, so, it follows that, in this case,
there is a one-to-one correspondence between outcomes and strategies. Not
only is ﬂipping all Ccoins the most eﬃcient way to turn all individual coins
over, it is the only way to do so.
How do we know that in the case where gcd(C, g)=1a n d gis odd, any possible
outcome is able to be achieved? The answer is that there exists a strategy to
ﬂip any particular coin you care to point at. For example, in the case C=7
andg= 3, suppose you wish to ﬂip only coin c=1 . T h e n ,a l ly o un e e dd o
is execute the ﬁrst ﬁve of the above-mentioned, consecutively non-overlapping
coin ﬂip groups: (1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,1,2), (3,4,5), (6,7,1). Then, you will have
ﬂipped coins 1–7 twice, followed by ﬂipping coin c=1o n c e . S i m i l a r l y ,i fw e

overlapping coin ﬂip groups, but beginning at a diﬀerent part of the sequence:
(2,3,4), (5,6,7), (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,1,2). Similarly for any other individual
coin.
It follows that if we can ﬂip any individual coin of our choice, then we can
achieve any outcome we desire. For example, to ﬂip coins c=1andc= 2, we
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 337 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAPPENDIX D. STATISTICS ANSWERS
would combine the two above sets of ﬁve groups of three ﬂips, but remove the
three sets of redundant pairs, yielding: (3,4,5), (6,7,1), (2,3,4), (5,6,7).
The key to being able to ﬂip any individual coin is that we can keep Kof
the original Cconsecutively non-overlapping coin ﬂip groups, and contained
within them is an even number, E, say, of ﬂips of all coins, followed by one
extra ﬂip, or, alternatively, we ﬁnd that contained within them is an even
number Eﬂips of all but the last coin. For example, in the case C=7a n d
g=3 ,w ek e p t K=5g r o u p so f g=3ﬂ i p s ,a n dt h e yc o n t a i n e d E=2ﬂ i p s
of all C=7c o i n s ,p l u so n ee x t r aﬂ i p . I nt h ec a s e C=8a n d g=3 ,h o w e v e r ,
we ﬂip the ﬁst coin using the following consecutively non-overlapping coin ﬂip
groups: (1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,8,1), (2,3,4), (5,6,7). So, in this case, we keep K=5
groups of g=3c o i n s ,t h a tc o n t a i n E=2ﬂ i p so fa l lb u tt h el a s tc o i n .
More generally, if gcd(C, g)=1a n d gis odd, there exists K(which is odd)
andE(which is even) such that ( K·g)=( E·C)±1. (Note that Kmust
be odd, given that ( E·C)±1i so d da n d gis odd.) That is, we can ﬂip any
coin we wish to point at, and so, any outcome can be achieved, and so the
count of strategies equals the count of possible outcomes, and so ﬂipping all C
consecutively non-overlapping coin ﬂip groups is the only strategy, and thus
the most eﬃcient strategy, to ﬂip every individual coin.
Finally, we need to consider some other cases. Suppose that Cis perfectly
divisible by g(i.e., gcd(C, g)=g). For example, C=9a n d g=3 . T h e ni t
takes exactly C/gﬂips of non-overlapping groups of coins to ﬂip all individual
coins.
Otherwise, you cannot ﬂip all coins. For example, if gcd(C, g)=1b u t gis
even, like the case C=7a n d g= 2, it is not possible to ﬂip all coins, or a single
coin, because the groups cycle around in even pairs. You can, however, ﬂip
all but a single coin in this case. Similarly, if gcd(C, g)̸=1a n d gcd(C, g)̸=g,
like the case C=6a n d g= 4, then it is not possible to ﬂip all coins. Note also
that even in some simple cases where it is not the case that both gcd(C, g)=1
andgis odd, the strategies are no longer necessarily unique. For example, in
the case C=3a n d g=2 ,t h ec o i nﬂ i pg r o u p( 1 , 2 )p r o d u c e st h es a m eo u t c o m e
as the combination of (2,3) and (3,1). So, in this case, with only 2Cstrategies,
and some giving the same outcomes, not all 2Coutcomes are achievable.
Answer 4.52: In order for the maximum of three dice outcomes to be a four, the

long division yields 0.171 to three decimal places.
In fact, my ﬁrst attempt at this calculation used a visual approach. I imagined
a6×6 macro-cube that looks like a Rubik’s cube, where the outcomes on any
single dice are recorded along one of the axes. Then the 216 micro-cubes
making up the macro-cube represent all possible outcomes. So, outcomes
with all numbers less than or equal to 4 take up a 4 ×4 sub-cube. Similarly,
outcomes with all numbers less than or equal to 3 take up a 3 ×3s u b - c u b e
of the 4 ×4s u b - c u b e . T h u s ,o ft h e2 1 6p o s s i b l eo u t c o m e s ,t h ec o u n tw h e r e

Although not requested, the same “diﬀerence of cubes” technique reveals that
the probability of the maximum being a 1 is 1/216 (when all three dice return
a 1), being a 2 is 7/216, being a 3 is 19/216, being a 4 is 37/216, being a

Answer 4.53: A Poisson process exhibits a random arrival (or departure, or other
event) pattern as follows: First, the number of arrivals in any two disjoint
intervals of time must be independent of each other; second, for a very short
time interval δt, the probability of at least one arrival during that interval is
roughly proportional to the length of the time interval: λδt+o(δt), where
λis the intensity, or arrival rate, of the process and o(δt)i saf u n c t i o nt h a t
approaches zero as δt→0; and third, the probability that there are more than
one arrivals during time interval δtis also o(δt)( D e G r o o t ,1 9 8 9 ,p p .2 5 4 – 2 5 5 ) .
Under these assumptions, the inter-arrival times Xiof a Poisson process are
distributed exponential, fX(x)=λe−λxforx≥0, where λis the arrival rate,
and the mean of Xiis 1/ λ(DeGroot, 1989, p. 290).
The count of occurrences in any ﬁxed interval of time of length δtwill be
distributed Poisson with mean λδt(DeGroot, 1989, p. 255).36

Answer 4.54: Letpbe the probability of seeing any car drive by in 30 minutes.
I want to relate pto the stated probability of seeing any car drive by during
one hour. Let us assume that cars arrive as a Poisson process, with a ﬁxed
rate of arrivals per unit time and independent arrivals in any non-overlapping
periods. Then the probability of no cars in one hour is the product of the
probability of no cars in each half-hour. We are using the result that P(A∩
B)=P(A)P(B)i fAandBare independent events—and in this case each
event is the complement of the event that a car arrives in the non-overlapping
half hours. So, we deduce that 1 −0.36 = (1 −p)(1−p). It follows that
p=0.20.
Note that the naive answer here is to simply conclude that p(probability of
a car in 30 minutes) equals half the 36% number (i.e., half the probability of
ac a ri n6 0m i n u t e s ) . T h i si sn o ts e n s i b l e ,f o rt h es a m er e a s o nt h a t p=0.20
in the next 30 minutes does not yield p=1.00 in the next 2.5 hours, or
p=1.20 (impossible) in the next three hours: the probability of independent
events is not additive. Note that the probability of mutually exclusive events
is additive, but mutually exclusive events cannot be independent (unless at
least one occurs with probability zero).
Answer 4.55: Yes, this is an example of something called Simpson’s Paradox
(DeGroot, 1989, p. 548). There are several slightly diﬀerent ﬂavors of Simp-
son’s Paradox. They are each special cases of “statistical mix eﬀects” (Arm-
strong and Wattenberg, 2014). Mix eﬀects mean that aggregate numbers can
be aﬀected by changes in the relative size of subpopulations as well as the rel-
ative values within those subpopulations (Armstrong and Wattenberg, 2014).
In the case at hand, suppose Italy made 120 passes in the ﬁrst half, with 60
being successful (50%), and the U.S. made 50 passes, with only 10 being suc-
cessful (20%). In the second half, suppose Italy improved, making 60 passes,
with all 60 being successful (100%), and the U.S. also improved, making 200
passes with 190 being successful (95%). Italy looked better in each half, but
over the match as a whole, Italy had only a 66 .6˙6% success rate (120/180),
whereas the U.S. had an 80% success rate (200/250).
Armstrong and Wattenberg (2014) give the famous example of UC Berkeley
graduate admissions. It was found that 44% of male applicants were accepted,
whereas only 35% of female applicants were accepted. Rather than being

favor of the female applicants.
Here is another example of a mix eﬀect. Suppose my students sign up for
class at the start of the semester. You would not be surprised to ﬁnd that
the average height of the men is larger than the average height of the women.
The overall average will be between the averages of the two sexes. Suppose,
however, that a female student signs up late because she was playing in a
sports match out of town. Suppose that this new student is tall for a woman,
but still of height less than the previous overall average. Then, although the
average height of the women goes up and the average height of the men is
unchanged, the average height of the class as a whole must go down.
Answer 4.56: With fair coins, the symmetry in payoﬀs must give an expected
payoﬀ of zero. You get payoﬀ -6 (HH) with probability 1/4, +5 (HT or TH)

Suppose you play the game Ntimes, where Nis a large number. Then, sure
enough, the expected payoﬀ is zero for every game, and therefore zero overall,
but you have a problem.

where V(·) denotes variance. For large N, a standard central limit theorem

but with standard deviation/r⎬dic⎬l⎭ig
N·51/2. Thus, as Ngrows, so too does the
standard deviation of the accumulated payoﬀs.
If you play 20,000 games, then, sure enough, E[D(N)] = 0, but V[D(N)] =
510,000, which means the standard deviation of your payoﬀs is $714.14, round-
ing to pennies. If you play one million games, then V[D(N)] = 25 ,500,000,
yielding a standard deviation of payoﬀs of $5,049.75, rounding to pennies. For
two million games, the standard deviation of the payoﬀ is $7,141.43, rounding
to pennies. In the last case, there is a roughly 5% chance that your gain or

loss will exceed 1.96 standard deviations (i.e., a 5% chance of gains or losses
beyond plus or minus $13,997.20, respectively).
Samuelson (1963) would argue that from a utility standpoint, playing the
original game once is unattractive because it has positive risk, but an expected
payoﬀ of zero. He would argue that playing it many times is all the more
unattractive.
Answer 4.57: Reconsider the game from Question 4.56, but allow that your coin
has probability p(of your choice) of getting a head, and your opponent’s coin
has probability p′(of his or her choice, after knowing p)o fg e t t i n gah e a d .
So, you get payoﬀ -6 (HH) with probability p·p′,+ 5( H To rT H )w i t hp r o b a -

Ifb>0, your opponent wants to minimize b·p′+aand chooses the lowest

Note, however, that b>0i m p l i e s9 −20p>0i m p l i e s p< 9/20. So, the

Ifb<0, your opponent wants to minimize b·p′+aand chooses the highest

however, that b<0i m p l i e s9 −20p<0i m p l i e s p>9/20. So, your expected
payoﬀ is 5 −11p<5−99/20 = $ 1/20 (i.e., again, you get an expected payoﬀ

Equation D.15 says that the variance of payoﬀ, V(Xn), increases in p′for
each game. I think that risk aversion dictates that the opponent will choose
p′= 0, so as to minimize the variability of his or her payoﬀs. (Any other p′
changes the numbers in the remainder of my answer, but does not change the
qualitative story.) Thus we obtain V(Xn)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

The question asks about repeated play. So, let D(N)≡/summ⎬tiontextN

If you play 200 games, then E[D(N)] = $10, and the standard deviation of
your payoﬀs is $63.32, rounding to pennies. The probability that you lose
isP[D(N)<0]≈P[(D(N)−10)/63 .32<−10/63 .32]≈N(−0.1579) ≈

If you play 20,000 games, however, then E[D(N)] = $1 ,000, and the stan-
dard deviation of your payoﬀs is $633.21, rounding to pennies, which carries
ar o u g h l y N(−1.579) ≈5.7% chance of a loss.
If you play 2,000,000 games, then E[D(N)] = $100 ,000, and the standard
deviation of your payoﬀs is $6,332.06, which carries virtually no chance of a
loss (because N(−15.79)≈0).
So, unlike in Answer 4.56, repeated play is attractive here. Now you are like
the owner of the casino that accepts only small bets, with a small edge in
every game, and (almost) sure long-run proﬁts.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 344 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAnswer 4.58: You were asked to “write down the central limit theorem. ” In fact,
this question is not well posed because many diﬀerent central limit theorems
(CLTs) exist. They diﬀer in their assumptions (e.g., dependent data versus
independent data or ﬁnite variances versus inﬁnite variances, etc.) and in their
dimensions (i.e, univariate versus multivariate).37

Answer 4.59: This is a practical question; I often need to simulate correlated
stock returns when simulating panel data for portfolio theory applications.
A certain amount of caution is required. The interviewer said that Z1and
Z2are “uncorrelated” and “Gaussian.” There are two possible interpretations,
with slightly diﬀerent answers. Let us take the simpler case ﬁrst, with the
strongest assumptions.
Case 1: It h i n kt h a tt h ei n t e r v i e w e rm e a n tt h a t Z1and Z2are together
bivariate normally distributed. In this case, Z1andZ2being uncorrelated
implies that Z1andZ2are independent (Crack, 2020a). If we then deﬁne X1
andX2as in Equations D.16 and D.17,
X1=σ1·Z1+µ1 (D.16)
X2=σ2·/⎭r⎬cketleft⎭igg

then X1∼N(µ1,σ2
1),X2∼N(µ2,σ2
2), and corr( X1,X2)=ρ(DeGroot, 1989,
p. 301), as requested. In this case, X1andX2are, like Z1andZ2, bivariate
normally distributed (Crack, 2020a), and their joint density function is given
as follows for −∞<x1,x2<∞(DeGroot, 1989, p. 301):

.
In the case where σ1=σ2=1a n d µ1=µ2=0 , X1andX2are, like Z1andZ2,
bivariate standard normally distributed. Note, however, that corr( X1,X2)=ρ
(so that fX1,X2(x1,x2) looks like a pinched bell in three dimensions), whereas
37See, for example, Feller (1971, pp. 258–265), Rao (1973, p. 128), White (2001), Crack and
Ledoit (2010), and Crack (2018).

corr( Z1,Z2)=0( s ot h a t fZ1,Z2(z1,z2)l o o k sl i k eas y m m e t r i cb e l li nt h r e e
dimensions).
Case 2: It is possible, though unlikely, that this is a deeper question. If
the interviewer meant that Z1and Z2are distributed univariate standard
normal, then Z1andZ2being uncorrelated does notimply that Z1andZ2
are independent. The key distinction here is that if two random variables are
uncorrelated, then this means that they have no linear dependence, but they
may still have non-linear dependence (Crack, 2020a).
In the case where Z1andZ2are distributed univariate standard normal and
are uncorrelated, deﬁning X1and X2as in Equations D.16 and D.17 still
yields corr( X1,X2)=ρ, as required (because Equations D.16 and D.17 are
linear transformations). We still get that X1∼N(µ1,σ2
1) (because X1is a
linear transformation of Z1). It is no longer true, however, that X2need be
normally distributed, and it is no longer true that X1andX2need be bivariate
normally distributed (Crack, 2020a). The problem is that only in the case
where Z1andZ2are univariate normal and independent (or equivalently where
Z1andZ2are distributed bivariate normally) does it follow that all possible
linear combinations of Z1andZ2are normally distributed. Otherwise simple
counterexamples can be built where linear combinations of Z1andZ2are not
normally distributed and Z1andZ2are not bivariate normally distributed
(see Crack, 2020a).
Answer 4.60: Before deﬁning the p-value, let us discuss statistical size. The
statistical size (i.e., signiﬁcance level) of a test is a pre-determined number. It
is often a small number, like, say, 5%. This statistical size is the probability
that you make a Type I error (i.e., the error you make when you reject the
null hypothesis even though it is true).
Thep-value associated with a particular realization of a statistical test is the
post-determined statistical size at which the value of the realized test statistic
exactly equals the critical value (or one of the critical values) for rejection of
the null hypothesis given your estimated parameter value(s). Equivalently, at
least in a univariate case, the estimated parameter value (that feeds into the
test statistic) sits at one end of a 100- p%c o n ﬁ d e n c ei n t e r v a lf o rt h ep o p u l a t i o n
parameter value. It follows that for a pre-determined statistical size, any
realized p-value at or less than that statistical size leads to a rejection of the
null hypothesis.
Before you conduct your statistical test, the p-value, like the test statistic
itself, is a random variable. If we have a continuous random variable test
statistic, then, under the null hypothesis, the p-value is distributed uniformly
on the interval [0 1].

Answer 5.2.11: Why are they asking why they chose you to come to a ﬁnal
round interview? They are asking because the job is yours to lose! Put yourself
in the interviewers’ shoes. After much eﬀort they have whittled many candidates
down to a shortlist. The easiest way to cross names oﬀ the shortlist is to bring you
all back and have you each explain why you are there. Anyone who says something
stupid gets struck oﬀ the list. The last person left standing gets the job.
What are they trying to get at with this question? It comes back to the four
points of the compass mentioned on p. 40: skills ,ﬁt,eﬀort ,a n d acceptance .A f t e r
spending time with them in previous rounds, you must be able to reiterate why you
are a good candidate: you have the skills that they seek; you ﬁtinto the culture in
their organization; you are willing/able to put in the eﬀort they require; you will
accept a job if oﬀered to you with reasonable terms.
What answers are they looking for? They want you to walk them through each
of the above four points, tailoring your answer to what you have learned about them
and what they have learned about you. They want you, but either they have some
minor doubts remaining about you or they just can’t choose between candidates.
They are now giving you one ﬁnal chance to kill your chances. Don’t put a foot

the statement “I don’t think you are the right person for the job.” He believed it,
but he knew the candidate was talented and he was interviewing him just in case.

Answer 5.3.3: By 2015, yields on at least a dozen countries’ government bonds
had turned negative. Bond yields in these countries had already been low, because
their governments were trying to boost economic growth. (In theory, low interest
rates encourage borrowing to fund corporate investment, and low interest rates
also discourage saving, so that individuals are more likely to spend money and
boost economic activity.) Rates were pushed into negative territory both because of
the central governments’ original growth motivations and because of compounding
economic forces.
By the end of 2015, roughly 5% of investment-grade bonds outstanding globally
had negative yields, and by Q3 of 2019, this ﬁgure peaked at 29% (Mee, 2019),
before falling back to about 20% by the end of 2019 (Ainger, 2019). The dollar bloc
was a holdout, oﬀering low but positive yields (Mee, 2019), but in late-March 2020,
COVID-19 disruption pushed stock prices down dramatically. The accompanying
ﬂight to quality pushed yields on three-month U.S. Treasuries into negative terri-
tory (Bloomberg, 2020a), and soon afterwards yields on both three- and six-month
U.S. Treasures turned negative (Bloomberg, 2020b). The U.S. Treasury yield curve,
which had been inverted as recently as mid-February 2020, became upward sloping
a week earlier (WGB, 2020). Negative U.S. Treasury yields reverted to positive ter-
ritory over the following month, except for TIPS, whose yields became increasingly
negative over the following few months (Bloomberg, 2020c).
Many of the countries with negative yields in 2015 had negative targets for key
short-term rates (PIMCO, 2016), but they had not originally issued long-term bonds
with negative yields. So, how can a low-yield bond become a negative-yield bond?
It happens when investors, fearful of further deterioration in the local or global
economy, rush to the quality of government bonds. This risk-oﬀ trade pushes bond
prices up, even to the point where yields can become negative. This decline in
yields can be further reinforced if some traders bet on yields becoming even more
negative, and choose to buy bonds at negative yields hoping for capital gains as
yields continue to fall. Many European governments did subsequently issue bonds
with negative initial yields. For example, the U.K. issued bonds with negative yields
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 348 All Rights Reserved Worldwidefor the ﬁrst time in May 2020 (Ostroﬀ, 2020).
Why buy negative-yield bonds? There are at least a half-dozen reasons:
•It could be a speculative bet that yields will become even more negative, as
mentioned already.
•Of course, some investors (e.g., banks, for capital adequacy reasons) are required
to hold government bonds. So, their demand exists regardless of yield.
•Note also that if a country experiences deﬂation that is worse than its negative
bond yields, then investors in those negative-yield bonds still get a positive
real yield.
•A foreign negative-yield bond may appear attractive once you hedge it into your
domestic currency. For example, a U.S. investor buying a German 10-year
bond in September 2019 with a -60 bps yield may pick up enough yield that
the hedged German bond yield is comparable to, if not superior to, the U.S.
10-year Treasury yield (Mee, 2019). This yield pick-up is driven by the interest
rate diﬀerential between the countries.
•Another reason to buy negative-yield bonds is that they may have negative betas.
Investors may be prepared to hold negative-beta assets (even with negative
expected returns) if they are powerful diversiﬁers. I certainly saw days in Q1
of 2020 when U.S. stock prices and U.S. bond prices were running full-tilt in
opposite directions.
•Yet another reason to hold negative-yield bonds is that long-term bonds are in
demand for use in liability-driven investing (LDI) in pension funds (Mee, 2019).
Yield is at best a secondary consideration for a duration-matching strategy
that uses bonds to match forecast liabilities.
What are the implications of negative government bond yields? Negative Trea-
sury rates lead to low corporate rates. These low rates can squeeze proﬁts for banks.
With the proﬁt incentive subdued, banks may lend less; this is an unintended out-
come. To address this reduced proﬁtability, banks may also charge higher fees for
originating mortgages or other loans; this is another unintended outcome (CNBC,
2019).
Note, however, that negative short-term government interest rates do not auto-
matically lead to negative interest rates at your bank, or negative yields on corporate
bonds—because of the default risk premium and the term premium.1
1Nevertheless, UBS announced in August 2019 that it would charge a negative 75 bps interest
rate for very large EUR deposits; something already being done by several competitors (Reuters,
2019). Also, in August 2019, a 10-year corporate bond (originally issued by Nestl´ ei nN o v e m b e r
2017 with a 1.25% yield and a 12-year maturity) became the ﬁrst ever 10-year corporate bond to
experience a negative yield (Molony, 2019). Nestl´ eh a d ,h o w e v e r ,p r e v i o u s l ye x p e r i e n c e dn e g a t i v e
yields on shorter-maturity debt (Thompson and Moore, 2015). Part of the explanation is that
Nestl´ e’s debt is AA rated by multiple rating agencies, so investors rush to their debt when seeking
safety, pushing prices up and yields down. Another part of the explanation is that term premiums
in Europe have reduced substantially in recent years (Molony, 2019).

Suppose Sweden (read any country not the U.S.) pushes its short-term govern-
ment interest rates into negative territory. This move may send Swedish institutional
bond investors to U.S. Treasuries instead, in order to ﬁnd safe bonds with a yield
(a carry trade in currencies, presumably unhedged). This unexpected demand may
drive up the price of U.S. Treasuries, driving down yields. This revealed demand
means that non-U.S. institutions, especially banks, may view the USD as their new
reserve currency.
What happens if the U.S. government pushes short-term rates negative, with

currency then? Is it the GBP, EUR, AUD, or what? The global shifts in asset
holding that accompany a change in eﬀective reserve currencies will distort currency
markets, and the consequences could have deep impacts on global trade (CNBC,
2019).
Note, ﬁnally, that in the 1930s and early 1940s, most coupon-bearing U.S. gov-
ernment bonds had negative nominal yields as they approached maturity. Sure
enough, interest rates were low, and some of the above-mentioned economic factors
were at play, along with tax considerations (Cecchetti, 1988). A bigger driver of
these negative yields was, however, that these bonds had embedded options giving
the holder the right to buy another Treasury security at an attractive price in the
future. So, investors were happy to “overpay” for the bonds, relative to the promised
coupons, giving the appearance of negative nominal yields (Cecchetti, 1988).2
Answer 5.3.15: This is an extension of previous questions asking at what level
equity indices, or currencies, or interest rates or commodity prices are.
It h i n ky o uh a v et os t a t et h a tn o b o d yc a ng i v ea ne x a c tn u m b e rf o ras t o c km a r k e t
index one year ahead. Sales and trading requires, however, a hearty personality and
no lack of opinions. So, you have to provide an estimate.
I have to assume they mean the S&P 500. Obviously you need to know where
it is today. You get to choose whether to provide an average sort of estimate (that
is, growth in the next year will be similar to average of growth rates in the past),
or provide a bullish or bearish estimate.
An average sort of estimate is obtained by taking today’s level and adding some-
thing like 6–7% per annum for average historical annual growth in the index level
(note that this forecast excludes dividend yield—which historically has been around
3% per annum—because the index levels do not include dividends) (Crack, 2020b,
2As an aside, I watched Fischer Black present his working paper “Interest Rates as Options”
at Harvard in late 1993 (subsequently published after his death as Black [1995]). Black assumes
that nominal short-term interest rates cannot be negative, because you have the option to hold
cash, thereby earning a (superior) zero rate. Thus, we may think of nominal rates as the maximum
of some “shadow rate” that can be negative, and the zero rate you earn in cash. I had, however,
seen negative nominal Treasury rates in CRSP data from the 1930s and 1940s. I talked to Fischer
Black about something else after the presentation, and then I subsequently wrote him a letter at
Goldman Sachs in New York to ask him about these negative rates. We talked on the phone, and
as he started to explain about the embedded options, I jumped to the above conclusion about
“overpaying,” which he said was correct. He kindly mailed me a copy of Cecchetti’s paper.

Given volatility in equity index levels, however, it is important to know that we
rarely get an average year in equities! For example, over the 91 years from 1928
to 2018 there was only one year where the total return on the S&P 500 was within
1% of the average annual return over that time period, and only 17 years where the
return on the S&P 500 was within 5% of that average (Crack, 2020b, Chapter 1).
Instead of an average estimate, I think a more interesting answer might be to
argue for either a bullish or a bearish outcome, and to have a really good justiﬁcation
ready. You might condition your forecast on growth rates in China, your outlook
for interest rate changes, oil prices, employment, recent stock market behavior, etc.
Answer 5.3.20: Asking about market eﬃciency is very common in portfolio
management interviews. Market eﬃciency means that prices (typically stock prices)
reﬂect information to the extent that consistent positive trading proﬁts cannot be
made after accounting for transaction costs, taxes and risk aversion (each of which
retards trading on news). There is a great deal of empirical evidence over the last
50 years to suggest that markets are largely eﬃcient. Nevertheless, there exist many
small deviations from eﬃciency, even in the larger markets, and prices that respond
to news correctly on average (which is what most academic studies look at) leave
much room for under- and over-reaction, and for trading opportunities.
Answer 5.3.25: This is basic macroeconomics, and you should be fully familiar
with it. The two forms of macroeconomic policy are monetary policy and ﬁscal
policy. Monetary policy tries to achieve the broad objectives of economic policy
through control of the monetary system and by operating on the supply of money,
the level and structure of interest rates, and other conditions aﬀecting the supply
of credit (Pearce [1984, p. 291]). With monetary policy, the Federal Reserve Bank
(“the Fed”) sell bonds and reduces the money supply—an “open market operation.”
This increases interest rates (the cost of money) and makes capital expenditures
more costly. This in turn slows down growth in the economy and should ﬁght the
inﬂationary threat.
In addition to open market operations, the Fed implements monetary policy by
managing the discount rate (the rate the Fed charges banks for loans), adjusting the
Fed funds rate (the rate banks charge each other for loans of federal funds), managing
reserve requirements for banks (the proportion of a bank’s assets required to be held
in Treasury securities), and operations in the government repo (i.e., repurchase)
market.3
Fiscal policy refers to the use of taxation and government expenditure to regulate
the aggregate level of economic activity (Pearce [1984, p. 160]). Increasing taxes and
decreasing government spending should slow down growth in the economy and ﬁght
inﬂationary fears. Go to any standard macroeconomic text if you want more details

You give up the security now in exchange for cash, agreeing to repurchase the security at a later
date for a larger amount of cash. A repo is thus a collateralized loan. A reverse repo is the other
side of the deal—you purchase securities now with an agreement to sell them later. Repos range in
maturity from overnight (“O/N”) to as long as ﬁve years; shorter-term repos are the most popular.

on ﬁscal or monetary policy.
Answer 5.3.31: The “Dow Jones Dogs strategy” buys the “Dow Jones Dogs”
at the start of the year. These are the 10 Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
stocks with the highest dividend yield. They are dogs because you get a relatively
high dividend yield by having a low price relative to dividends. You are supposed
to rebalance the portfolio every year. Historically this has been a proﬁtable strat-
egy. The CBOE introduced options on a Dow Jones Dogs index (the index had
ticker symbol “MUT”) in 1999, but saw no volume in them in 2009, and the index
and options appear to have been delisted before 2014. Deutsche Bank oﬀered an
exchange-traded note (ETN) based on the return to the Dow Jones Dogs strategy
(ticker symbol “DOD”), but it no longer exists. MUT and DOD moved very closely
together when both existed. The ETN DODXF and ETF SDOG appear to have
taken their places, with both dramatically underperforming the Dow 30 for the ﬁve
years to August 2021.
Answer 5.4.3: Questions asking you to value a business are extremely common!
They are mostly about ﬁnance skills, but as always, they want to hear you talk your
way through it to see your personality (to see if you ﬁt), and they want to conﬁrm
that you can think on your feet under pressure (another valuable skill).
What are they trying to get at with this question? Skills, skills, skills. Can you
think on your feet and identify the important factors that feed into any business
valuation? Are you aware of competing valuation techniques? Did you miss anything
important?
What answers are they looking for? They do not necessarily need you to arrive
at a numerical answer in this case, because some of the inputs cannot be estimated
accurately until you do some research. So, I would focus on method, rather than
numerical answers in this case. In other valuation questions they might supply
enough data for a numerical answer, or they might sit you in front of EXCEL and
ask you to build a spreadsheet.
I would announce that I will try two diﬀerent techniques. My ﬁrst approach
involves market-determined prices for comparables: I know that NY sells licenses
for street vendors via competitive bids. So, supply and demand means that the
winning bids should give a rough estimate of a lower bound on the value. Winning
bids are likely public, and should at least put me in the ballpark. Diﬀerent locations
(e.g., beside a major tourist hotspot, near to or distant from competing vendors)
will carry diﬀerent values. I would try to ﬁnd something as comparable to the hot
dog stand of interest as possible.
For my second approach I would look at a standard discounted cash ﬂow (DCF)
analysis (Crack, 2020b). I need to forecast cash ﬂows and discount them back at an
appropriate discount rate. So, I need to say what kinds of cash ﬂows I will use and
where I will get them, what sort of horizon I should use, and what an appropriate
discount rate is.
I need unleveraged free cash ﬂows (FCF) to capital. I would go out maybe 7-10
years and estimate a terminal value there using a perpetuity. FCF are given by
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 352 All Rights Reserved Worldwideoperating cash ﬂows (OCF) plus changes in net working capital (NWC) less capital
expenditure (CAPEX) plus any sundry tax eﬀects.
To get OCF I have to make an estimate of the foot traﬃc I will see, the typical
transaction, the operating costs (ﬁxed cost of the license, equipment rental, wages
and variable costs of the product I sell), and depreciation (if I bought the stand). I
would need to do some research on these: I could observe some vendors, check out
wholesale costs of products, etc. NWC will be modelled in a spreadsheet, but given
high turnover, I think it will be a small run-up at the start and then nothing much
going on. CAPEX might be very low in this case if the stand is rented, or could be
quite high initially if the stand is purchased outright.
The cost of equity could come from comparable publically traded small busi-
nesses in a similar line, but via the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Something
like Chipotle might be a good place to start. Remember to unlever the beta from
the comparables and relever to your capital weighting (which is likely to be mostly
debt I assume). I also need a market risk premium; standard numbers are 5%–7%.
Ia l s on e e dm yc o s to fd e b tt oﬁ n dt h eW A C C .Iw o u l da s ks o m eb a n k i n gb u d d i e s
what they would charge for a loan to someone starting a hot dog stand.
It’s not enough to know the names of these concepts; you have to be prepared
for the interviewer to drill more deeply on any one of the above-mentioned items.
Other competing techniques for ﬁrm valuation include the LBO method (not
obviously better than DCF here), and the less-popular DDM method (but there are
no obvious dividends to discount) (Crack, 2020b).
If they actually want a numerical answer, then I have to start making guestimates
of all the above costs. Maybe a license is $10,000 per month, maybe the stand
operates eight hours a day and I have one minimum wage employee working with
me, maybe a stand costs $50,000 to build, or $1,000 per month to rent, maybe the
typical transaction is $7 with costs of $1 and we can serve two people per minute
for eight hours a day, etc. I think you’ll need pencil and paper or a whiteboard or
as p r e a d s h e e tt op u tt h i sa l lt o g e t h e r .
Answer 5.4.8: Given that ﬁxed operating costs produce operating leverage, I
expect that a 10% reduction in revenues will produce a more than 10% reduction in
operating cash ﬂows. Depending upon changes in net working capital, and CAPEX,
etc., maybe this will produce a 10%–15% reduction in free cash ﬂows, and a similar
reduction in ﬁrm valuation, other things being equal.
If the discount rate reduces by one percentage point, however, and if the discount
rate is in the 10% ballpark, then the simple gross return factor (1+ R)c h a n g e sf r o m ,
say, 1.10 to 1.09, which is only about a 1% relative change. If you compound this
ﬁve or 10 times, it is still only a 5% or 10% relative change, respectively (to a ﬁrst-
order approximation). If we take a weighted average of these simple gross return
discount rates, applied to the time series of free cash ﬂows, this will yield maybe
a 5% increase in ﬁrm value, other things being equal. Of course, this will depend
upon the distribution of free cash ﬂows through time.
In sum, I think a 10% reduction in revenues will have more than twice the
impact on ﬁrm valuation (and in the opposite direction) that we would see with a
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 353 All Rights Reserved WorldwideAPPENDIX E. NON-QUANTITATIVE ANSWERS (SELECTED)
one percentage point reduction in the discount rate.
Yes, you can almost certainly build a DCF model scenario where you prove me
wrong, but I suspect my numbers will be about right for a typical ﬁrm.
Answer 5.4.21: The answer given by the interviewer was that if you are Avis
or Hertz, cars are inventory. The same applies to an automobile manufacturer (or
any of their distributors).
Answer 5.4.29: No. FCF does not include interest payments or repayment of
principal because FCF is the cash ﬂows generated by net assets and available to the
owners of the company (both debt and equity holders). The tax beneﬁt of interest
payments is recognized in a lower after tax cost of debt in the WACC. Finally,
ﬁnancing costs are not cash outﬂows. They do not reduce cash available to owners.
To the contrary, they arecash payments to owners and, therefore, have no net eﬀect
on cash ﬂows available to owners (i.e., FCF).
Answer 5.5.3: My ﬁrst answer is to hand the bomb to my boss and run! More
seriously, if it is small, stick it in the fridge, pull the fridge to the ﬂoor (so the door
does not just shoot oﬀ), and run and hit the ﬁre alarm. If there is a vacant lot or
river (or some other unpopulated region) outside, can you break a window and toss
it out? Failing all of the above, put it against an external wall or window, and shove
something heavy against it, like a ﬂipped desk or two, to direct the blast outwards.
Answer 5.5.8: How many ping-pong balls can you ﬁt in a jumbo jet? Why do
they even ask these questions? Well, your reaction tells them about your skills. Not
just quant skills, but your ability to perform under pressure. If you are unprepared
for this sort of question, then it’s a left-ﬁeld shock. Some people freeze when shocked.
Some people just get up and walk out; I’ve seen it happen! The interviewer wants
to see how you perform under shock pressure.
After the initial shock is over, they want to see how you think about a quanti-
tative problem of a sort that is typically not taught in college. That is, you cannot
just do plain vanilla step-by-step algebra or calculus to solve it. It is a free-form
problem requiring estimation and loose approximations; some rigid quants cannot
solve this sort of problem. Do you have the skills to handle the shock pressure,
maintain composure, and solve the left-ﬁeld problem?
On one level, this is just a game. Beyond skills, they also want to know whether
you play well with others. That’s about ﬁt or culture. Your reactions reveal your
human nature. Your human nature reveals whether you ﬁt or not. Also, if you make
a clear concerted eﬀort, then it signals an interest in making an eﬀort more widely.
Also, if you are willing to play along and work hard for the answer, that signals the
attitude of someone who wants the job and is likely to accept it if oﬀered it.
You need to be sure to answer clearly with step-by-step logical reasoning spoken
out loud. If you close your mouth for 60 seconds and then declare the answer is
15 million, they have no idea how you got to the answer. They don’t actually care
about the numerical answer (assuming you are in the ballpark); they care only about
the demonstrated reasoning process!
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 354 All Rights Reserved WorldwideWhether its ping-pong balls in a 747, McDonald’s in the U.S., barbers in Chicago,
or pizzas eaten in the U.S., start by latching onto something you know about.
You have spent enough time on airplanes and you have seen enough ping-pong
balls in your life that you should be able to ﬁgure this out. So, let’s start with how
many people ﬁt inside a 747. (I would be speaking this out loud to the interviewer.)
Well, it varies, but 500 sounds about right (and maybe 200 for a 737—a popular
variation). Each person sits in a personal space about the size of a red British phone
booth. OK, the seat is narrower, but there are aisles and overhead lockers etc., so it
should be about right. A ping-pong ball is a bit bigger than one inch in diameter.
Ap h o n eb o o t hi sa b o u t3 6i n c h e sw i d e ,a n dl e t ’ ss a y7 5i n c h e sh i g h .M a y b ei ti s2 5
by 25 by 50 ping-pong balls in dimension. Although 252is 625, I am going to round
that to 600 for ease, and deduce that I get 30,000 ping-pong balls in a phone booth.
With 500 phone booths in the plane, ﬁve times three is 15 and I have to tag
those six zeroes on the end of it. So, 15 million is my answer, but I might round it
up to 20 million because those balls are not cubes, and they nestle in against each
other more eﬃciently than do little cubes, and there is more vertical space on a 747
than other craft. Of course, there are other solution techniques, but they all involve
approximations and some sort of estimation of relative volume.
Along the way I will ask the interviewer whether I include the cargo hold or not
(maybe increase my answer by 50% in that case), etc. Ask if you are not sure of the
assumptions. Maybe they have speciﬁc assumptions in mind.
Answer 5.5.9: As with the ping-pong balls question, there is no precise alge-
braic solution routine. You make several rough assumptions and hope the errors
cancel. For example, the U.S. population is about 325,000,000 (mid-2021). Let’s
just call it 300,000,000. The average population of Bloomington, Indiana, is about
100,000 (it is lower when the students are gone and higher when the students are
there). There are ﬁve McDonald’s in Bloomington. I calculate300,000,000
100,000×5=
3,000×5=1 5 ,000.So, my estimate is 15,000 McDonald’s outlets in the U.S.
Looking at online proﬁles of the company, and recent news stories, I estimate that
of 38,500 McDonald’s restaurants (mid-2021), roughly 14,000 of them are located
in the U.S. So, my estimate is very close.
In general, you grab something you know, scale it up or down, and adjust for
any biases. Let us try it again a diﬀerent way. I think the prime candidates for
eating at McDonald’s are between ﬁve and 30 years old. If lifespan is uniformly
distributed between zero and 75 years, then that is only one-third of the population
(100,000,000). Half of these people are health nuts. That leaves 50,000,000 cus-
tomers. Suppose they eat four meals per week. That works out to about 30,000,000
meals served per day in the U.S. If one outlet sells a burger every 20 seconds for
10 hours per day, that is 1,800 per day per outlet. Call it 2,000. 30,000,000 meals
served per day at 2,000 per outlet implies about 15,000 outlets. Same as before.
As always, ﬁnd something you know and scale it up or down. Be sure to know
the population of the Earth, the U.S., the city you live in, and the city you interview
in.

Answer 5.5.15: Ar e p r e s e n t a t i v eo ft h eb a n kt h a ta s k e dt h i sq u e s t i o na b o u t
Adolf Hitler subsequently denied that anyone at their bank would have asked this
question, perhaps because of the Jewish roots of the ﬁrm. Knowing bankers at that
ﬁrm, however, I am conﬁdent that they asked it, but then someone senior thought it
made bad PR to acknowledge it. So, be prepared for similarly distasteful questions.
This question is mostly about ﬁt (because your answer reveals your personality
and your character). It is also a little about skills (e.g., how ethical, tactful, honest,
direct, etc. are you?).
They purposefully picked a well-known and deeply-hated leader to bring your
character to light. They want to know whether you know more about Hitler than
just the well-known negatives. For example, Hitler uniﬁed a nation suﬀering hyper-
inﬂation and WWI reparation problems. His scientists invented rocket engines and
subsequently worked on the Apollo program that sent men to the moon. He spurred
the building of the autobahns, etc. Hitler is, of course, pretty much universally hated
for being deeply evil and unethical on so many diﬀerent fronts (e.g., invading inno-
cent countries, murdering millions of Jews, exploiting slave labor, etc.).
Hitler ultimately failed in pretty much all his grandiose endeavors because of
allied (and even internal) opposition to his policies and foolish and reckless misman-
agement of resources (e.g., invading Russia in winter, duh!).
It’s all about ﬁt, so whatever your view, be honest, or you risk ending up at a ﬁrm
where you don’t ﬁt and where you won’t prosper. My professional opinion is that
Hitler’s deeply evil/unethical behavior and reckless mismanagement of resources
make him a worthless individual and unﬁt for any role in any organization—no
constructive outcomes can possibly compensate for these negatives. On top of that,
my father served as a young man in the British Army during WWII, manning an
anti-aircraft battery in England. My mother’s house in England was bombed only
10 days after their family moved out of the city to a safer village. Each of my parents
was a witness to fear, death and destruction that scarred them for life. So, I think
the son-of-a-bitch deserves to burn in hell for eternity, and I’d have no hesitation in
saying so in an interview.
Are you, however, a cut throat mercenary who applauds Hitler’s leadership skills?
Do you just dispassionately view him as a case study we can learn from? Whatever
your view, tell the truth, make it plain and hope that you ﬁt.
Answer 5.5.16: The answer given by the interviewer was that you should
threaten to kill yourself by hitting your head against the wall. The administrative
nightmare that would follow would ruin the guard’s upcoming weekend. He would
have to give you a cigarette.
Answer 5.5.19: You have to ﬁgure that the coin is not fair. The probability of
another head is essentially one. See Huﬀ’s book, “How to Lie with Statistics,” for
related arguments (Huﬀ [1982, Chapter 3]).
In one of my other books, Foundations for Scientiﬁc Investing (Crack, 2020b), I
describe an experiment I performed in an undergraduate classroom. A student rolled
a pair of dice 36 times and we recorded on how many occasions a 7 or 11 occurred.
©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 356 All Rights Reserved WorldwideWe then compared the outcome to a binomial table. Then it was my turn. I palmed
the fair dice and swapped them for a loaded pair that always gives me a 7 or 11. As
the odds stacked up against me, the students watched in amazement. Even when
there was only one chance in a million that what they saw could be the result of
rolling fair dice, there were still a few students in a class of over a 100 stubbornly
clinging to the belief that the dice were fair. If I did the same in an MBA or
PhD class, the wizened students would all see through it immediately, but some
undergraduates are amazingly naive.
Answer 5.5.21: I have had several comments from readers on how to weigh a
jet plane: Land it on an aircraft carrier and measure the displacement of the ship;
land it on the ice (e.g., Arctic) and then crash into it with something big and see
how far it moves; look at the size of the tire footprints and deduce it from the tire
pressure. How about just looking in the manual?
Answer 5.5.27: I spent some time at NASA’s web site. NASA says there are
four forces on an airplane: thrust, drag, weight and lift. These forces move the air-
plane forward, backward, downward, and upward, respectively, and simultaneously.
For example, level forward ﬂight would require that lift balance weight, and that
thrust more than compensate for drag.
NASA indicates that there is considerable debate/confusion over how lift is gen-
erated. They describe lift as a mechanical force that is generated when a solid object
moves through a ﬂuid and “turns” the ﬂuid ﬂow. The shape and “angle of attack”
of an airplane’s wing turn the ﬂuid ﬂow downwards, and, by Newton’s Third Law of
Motion (i.e., for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction) this provides
upward lift.
NASA comments that wings are often shaped so that the wing, taken in cross
section, has more surface area on the top surface than the bottom surface. The
air ﬂows more quickly over the top of the wing than the bottom. The variation in
velocity of the ﬂuid creates a pressure diﬀerential that produces lift (via Bernoulli’s
Principle). They state, however, that this wing shape is not necessary to create lift.
Rather, it only contributes to it.
Answer 5.5.34: There are several possible responses that make sense. An obvi-
ous reason is safety: a round cover cannot fall down a round hole. Whereas if both
hole and cover are either square or rectangular or oval, the cover can easily fall down
the hole if lifted vertically and turned diagonally and dropped. Incidentally, I no-
ticed in New Zealand that some of their manholes have rectangular covers. However,
in this case, the covers are hinged and attached to a frame that is immovable—thus
preventing the cover from falling.
Another reason for being round is that the (very heavy) covers may be rolled
easily. Similarly, a (very heavy) round cover need not be manipulated before being
returned to its hole—it may be replaced in any orientation. Finally, and with some
sarcasm, manhole covers are round because the holes that they cover are round. It
is easier to drill a round hole in the street than a square one. Have you ever tried
drilling a square hole in anything?

Story: I was telephone-interviewing a candidate for an active equity research job
in London. His job would be the creation, testing, and implementation of strate-
gies for beating the market. I asked him if he could draw upon his considerable
experience in the markets to suggest to me a strategy he had heard of for beating
the market. There was a very long pause (at least 20 seconds, which is a long time
to hear nothing down a phone line), after which he answered simply “no. ” What
did he think I was going to ask him about?!

24 Essential Tips for Selling
Print Replica eBooks on Amazon:
How to Capture New Readers by
Turning Your Physical Book
into an eBook
Timothy Falcon Crack
PhD (MIT), MCom, PGDipCom, BSc (HONS 1stClass), IMC
This 54-page eBook gives more than two-dozen essential tips accumu-
lated over several years of turning self-published physical print books
into “print replica” eBooks sold on www.Amazon.com .A p r i n t r e p l i c a
eBook uses a simple pdf-formatted “text block” (i.e., the inside pages
of a book, as distinct from its cover). Most software packages can out-
put pdf ﬁles. So, there is no messing around with unfamiliar EPUB or
MOBI formatting, HTML code, or reﬂowable eBooks (i.e., where the
book reorganizes itself when the reader resizes the text). I assume that
you have the content written and a cover image ready, and that you can
handle marketing. My only goal is to guide you through the process of
getting set up to sell “print replica” eBooks on www.Amazon.com .A l -
though written as if you want to turn physical print books into eBooks,
this is not a prerequisite. For example, there is no physical print edition
ofthiseBook, but I followed the advice given here to set it up and sell
it on Amazon. If you are not selling eBooks, then you are missing out
on customers who prefer (or are tempted by) immediate delivery!

Interviews With
Top University Teachers
How to Build Quality Teaching,
Inspire Your Students, and
Create More Time for Research
Timothy Falcon Crack
PhD (MIT), MCom, PGDipCom, BSc (HONS 1stClass), IMC
My goal is to help university teachers to build quality into their teaching.
Quality teaching should inspire students and meet learning objectives,
while exploiting teaching eﬃciencies that create more time for research.
These outcomes should, in turn, improve job satisfaction and prospects
for career success. To meet these goals, I conducted interviews with a
select sample of outstanding university teachers in the U.S., U.K., Aus-
tralia, Israel, and New Zealand. I interwove their advice with reﬂections
upon my own 30-year award-winning university teaching career in the
U.S. and in New Zealand. The advice is accompanied by a discussion of
practical attitudes towards teaching and teaching motivation, and sto-
ries (and even some horror stories) that serve as parables. The majority
of the advice is based on face-to-face instruction in the classroom, but
much of it carries over to remote/online teaching. Much of the advice is
“purely mechanical,” in the sense that you don’t need any special skills
or abilities to implement it. Teachers can use this book to improve their
job performance and job satisfaction, and to increase the likelihood of
promotion and career success. Administrators can give this book to new
university teachers to help build quality teaching from Day 1.

Pocket Heard on The Street
Timothy Falcon Crack
PhD (MIT), MCom, PGDipCom, BSc (HONS 1stClass), IMC
Two pocket-sized editions of ﬁnance job interview questions. Compared
with the full-sized edition of Heard on The Street ,t h e s ep o c k e te d i t i o n s
are cheaper, physically smaller, and have fewer pages. They contain a
careful selection of the best questions from the full-sized edition of Heard
on The Street .T h e p o c k e t e d i t i o n s a r e e a s y t o p u t i n y o u r p o c k e t o r
purse, and easy to read on the subway, bus, train, or plane! Pocket Heard
on The Street: Quantitative Questions from Finance Job Interviews is a
careful selection of the 75 best quantitative questions taken from the full-
sized edition of Heard on The Street . Presented with detailed solutions.
Pocket Heard on The Street: Brain Teasers, Thinking Questions, and
Non-Quantitative Questions from Finance Job Interviews is a careful
selection of 20 brain teasers, 30 thinking questions, and over 100 non-
quantitative questions taken from the full-sized edition of Heard on The
Street .T h eb r a i nt e a s e r s ,a n dm o r et h a nh a l ft h et h i n k i n gq u e s t i o n sa r e
presented with detailed solutions. Whereas the quantitative questions
in the ﬁrst pocket edition usually require math/stats, the brain teasers
and “thinking questions” in the second pocket edition usually require
little or no math. The thinking questions fall half-way between brain
teasers and true quantitative questions.

Basic Black-Scholes:
Option Pricing and Trading
Timothy Falcon Crack
PhD (MIT), MCom, PGDipCom, BSc (HONS 1stClass), IMC
This book gives extremely clear explanations of Black-Scholes option
pricing theory, and discusses direct applications of the theory to option
trading. The presentation does not go far beyond basic Black-Scholes for
three reasons: First, a novice need not go far beyond Black-Scholes to
make money in the options markets; Second, all high-level option pricing
theory is simply an extension of Black-Scholes; and Third, there already
exist many books that look far beyond Black-Scholes without ﬁrst lay-
ing the ﬁrm foundation given here. The trading advice does not go far
beyond elementary call and put positions because more complex trades
are simply combinations of these. The appendix includes Black-Scholes
option pricing code for the HP17B, HP19B, and HP12C. This edition
includes Bloomberg screens and expanded analysis of Black-Scholes in-
terpretations. This edition is also accompanied by two downloadable
spreadsheets. The ﬁrst spreadsheet allows the user to forecast proﬁts
and transactions costs for option positions using simple models. The
second spreadsheet allows the user to explore option sensitivities includ-
ing the Greeks.
The latest edition is available at all reputable online booksellers.

Foundations for Scientiﬁc Investing:
Capital Markets Intuition and
Critical Thinking Skills
Timothy Falcon Crack
PhD (MIT), MCom, PGDipCom, BSc (HONS 1stClass), IMC
This book lays a ﬁrm foundation for thinking about and conducting invest-
ment. It does this by helping to build capital markets intuition and critical
thinking skills.
This book is the product of 25+ years of investment research and experience
(academic, personal, and professional), and 20+ painstaking years of destruc-
tive testing in university classrooms. Although the topic is applied investments,
my integration of ﬁnance, economics, accounting, pure mathematics, statistics,
numerical techniques, and spreadsheets (or programming) make this an ideal
capstone course at the advanced undergraduate or masters/MBA level. I
adopt a heavily scientiﬁc/quantitative focus, but most of the material should
be accessible to a motivated practitioner or talented individual investor with
only high school level mathematics.
Contents include literature reviews in advanced areas, unanswered research
questions suitable for a master’s or PhD thesis, an active alpha optimization
exercise using actual stock market data, advanced TVM exercises, a review of
retirement topics, an extensive discussion of dividends, P/E ratios, transaction
costs, the CAPM, and value versus growth versus glamour, and a review of more
than 100 years of stock market performance and more than 200 years of interest
rates. Special attention is paid to diﬃcult topics like the Roll critique, smart
beta, factor-based investing, and Grinold-Kahn versus Black-Litterman models.
Every investor needs capital markets intuition and critical thinking skills to
conduct conﬁdent, deliberate, and skeptical investment. The overarching goal
of this book is to help investors build these skills.
The latest edition is available at all reputable online booksellers.

Foundations for Scientiﬁc Investing:
Multiple-Choice, Short Answer, and
Long-Answer Test Questions
Timothy Falcon Crack
PhD (MIT), MCom, PGDipCom, BSc (HONS 1stClass), IMC
This book accompanies Foundations for Scientiﬁc Investing .I t p r o -
vides 600+ test questions (600+ multiple-choice, 125 short-answer ques-
tions, and the long-answer questions already appearing in Foundations
for Scientiﬁc Investing ). Suggested solutions to the multiple-choice and
short-answer questions are given. These solutions are also available,
free of charge, at the Web site for the book. If you have purchased the
eBook version of this book (which uses DRM-PDF and is not able to
be printed), it might be easiest to print out the Web-based solutions to
consult while viewing the eBook questions. The multiple choice ques-
tions may also be useful as a test bank for instructors in any advanced
investments class.

How to Ace Your Business Finance Class:
Essential Knowledge and Techniques to
Master the Material and Ace Your Exams
Timothy Falcon Crack
PhD (MIT), MCom, PGDipCom, BSc (HONS 1stClass), IMC
This pocket-sized book is aimed at students in their ﬁrst ﬁnance class
at the undergraduate, MBA, or executive education level. I use 25 years
of experience teaching this material to explain carefully the stumbling
blocks that have consistently tripped up students year after year. This
gives every student every opportunity to master the material. I also
present safe strategies I have developed to help you solve numerical
problems. Although these strategies take only an extra minute to im-
plement, they frame each numerical problem so as to increase the like-
lihood that you detect and ﬁx any errors, while reducing the likelihood
that you make any errors in the ﬁrst place. These techniques also in-
crease the likelihood that you earn partial credit. Although this book
is aimed primarily at students, the fact that I focus on essential knowl-
edge and techniques also makes this book useful to instructors. The
chapters of the book are as follows: Foundations, Financial Statements,
TVM I (One Cash Flow), TVM II (Multiple Cash Flows), Inﬂation and
Indices, Bonds and Interest Rates, Equities and Dividend Discount Mod-
els, Capital Budgeting I (Decision Rules), Capital Budgeting II (Cash
Flows), Capital Budgeting III (Cost of Capital), Capital Budgeting IV
(A Paradox), The CAPM and Interest Rates, Risk and Return, Market
Eﬃciency, Capital Structure, and Dividends.
The latest edition is available at all reputable online booksellers.
