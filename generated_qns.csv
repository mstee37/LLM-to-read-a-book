3 technical financial markets questions (source from FRM, CFA)

3 problem solving questions/puzzles/brainteasers

3 probability and combinatorics questions

3 logic questions
","Certainly! Here are some additional interview questions and suggested answers to help you prepare for a trading role in the sales and trading division of an investment bank or a quant trading firm:

### Technical Financial Markets Questions

1. **Question:** What is the Sharpe Ratio and why is it important in portfolio management?

   **Suggested Answer:** The Sharpe Ratio is a measure used to evaluate the risk-adjusted return of an investment portfolio. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the portfolio's return and dividing the result by the portfolio's standard deviation. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a more attractive risk-adjusted return, making it a crucial metric for comparing the performance of different portfolios.

2. **Question:** Explain the concept of duration and its significance in bond investing.

   **Suggested Answer:** Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in interest rates, expressed in years. It estimates how much the price of a bond will change for a 1% change in interest rates. Duration is significant because it helps investors understand the interest rate risk associated with a bond or bond portfolio.

3. **Question:** What is the difference between forward contracts and futures contracts?

   **Suggested Answer:** Forward contracts are customized agreements between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on a future date. They are traded over-the-counter and are not standardized. Futures contracts, on the other hand, are standardized agreements traded on exchanges, with specified terms and conditions. Futures contracts have more liquidity and are subject to daily settlement.

### Problem Solving Questions/Puzzles/Brainteasers

1. **Question:** You have a 3-gallon jug and a 5-gallon jug. How can you measure exactly 4 gallons of water?

   **Suggested Answer:** Fill the 5-gallon jug completely. Pour water from the 5-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug until the 3-gallon jug is full, leaving 2 gallons in the 5-gallon jug. Empty the 3-gallon jug and transfer the 2 gallons from the 5-gallon jug to the 3-gallon jug. Fill the 5-gallon jug again and pour water into the 3-gallon jug until it is full. This leaves exactly 4 gallons in the 5-gallon jug.

2. **Question:** A farmer has 17 sheep and all but 9 die. How many sheep are left?

   **Suggested Answer:** There are 9 sheep left. The phrase ""all but 9 die"" means that 9 sheep remain alive.

3. **Question:** How many times do the hands of a clock overlap in a 24-hour period?

   **Suggested Answer:** The hands of a clock overlap 22 times in a 24-hour period. They overlap approximately every 65 minutes.

### Probability and Combinatorics Questions

1. **Question:** What is the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two six-sided dice?

   **Suggested Answer:** There are 6 possible outcomes that result in a sum of 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1). Since there are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, the probability is 6/36, which simplifies to 1/6.

2. **Question:** How many different ways can you arrange the letters in the word ""FINANCE""?

   **Suggested Answer:** The word ""FINANCE"" has 7 letters, with the letter ""N"" repeating twice. The number of different arrangements is 7! / 2! = 2,520.

3. **Question:** If you flip a fair coin three times, what is the probability of getting exactly two heads?

   **Suggested Answer:** The possible outcomes are HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, HHH, and TTT. There are 3 outcomes with exactly two heads. The probability is 3/8.

### Logic Questions

1. **Question:** You have a 5-minute hourglass and a 7-minute hourglass. How can you measure exactly 8 minutes?

   **Suggested Answer:** Start both hourglasses at the same time. When the 5-minute hourglass runs out, flip it immediately. When the 7-minute hourglass runs out, flip it immediately. When the 5-minute hourglass runs out again (after 10 minutes total), the 7-minute hourglass will have 2 minutes of sand left. Let it run for those 2 minutes to measure exactly 8 minutes.

2. **Question:** A man is looking at a portrait. Someone asks him, ""Whose picture are you looking at?"" The man replies, ""Brothers and sisters, I have none. But that man's father is my father's son."" Who is in the portrait?

   **Suggested Answer:** The man in the portrait is his son. ""My father's son"" refers to himself, so ""that man's father"" is him, making the man in the portrait his son.

3. **Question:** You have two ropes that each take exactly one hour to burn, but they burn at inconsistent rates. How can you measure exactly 45 minutes?

   **Suggested Answer:** Light both ends of the first rope and one end of the second rope at the same time. The first rope will burn completely in 30 minutes. At that point, light the other end of the second rope. It will take 15 more minutes for the second rope to burn completely, totaling 45 minutes.",808,1151,1959,$0.013530

### Technical Financial Markets Questions

1. **Question:** What is Value at Risk (VaR) and how is it used in risk management?

   **Suggested Answer:** Value at Risk (VaR) is a statistical measure that estimates the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval. It is used in risk management to quantify the level of financial risk within a firm or portfolio over a specific time frame. For example, a daily VaR of $1 million at a 95% confidence level implies that there is a 5% chance that the portfolio will lose more than $1 million in a day.

2. **Question:** Explain the concept of beta in the context of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

   **Suggested Answer:** Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. In the context of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), beta is used to determine the expected return of an asset based on its risk relative to the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the asset is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than 1 indicates that it is less volatile. CAPM uses beta to calculate the expected return by considering the risk-free rate, the asset's beta, and the market risk premium.

3. **Question:** What is the difference between systematic and unsystematic risk?

   **Suggested Answer:** Systematic risk, also known as market risk, is the risk inherent to the entire market or market segment. It is influenced by factors such as economic changes, political events, or natural disasters and cannot be eliminated through diversification. Unsystematic risk, on the other hand, is specific to a particular company or industry and can be mitigated through diversification. Examples include business risk and financial risk.

### Problem Solving Questions/Puzzles/Brainteasers

1. **Question:** You have 8 balls of equal size. 7 of them weigh the same, and one is slightly heavier. How can you find the heavier ball using a balance scale only twice?

   **Suggested Answer:** Divide the balls into three groups: two groups of three balls and one group of two balls. First, weigh the two groups of three balls against each other. If they balance, the heavier ball is in the group of two. Weigh the two balls against each other to find the heavier one. If the groups of three do not balance, take the heavier group and weigh any two balls from it. The heavier ball will either be the one that tips the scale or the one not weighed if they balance.

2. **Question:** How can you measure exactly 6 liters of water using only a 4-liter jug and a 9-liter jug?

   **Suggested Answer:** Fill the 9-liter jug completely. Pour water from the 9-liter jug into the 4-liter jug until the 4-liter jug is full, leaving 5 liters in the 9-liter jug. Empty the 4-liter jug and transfer the 5 liters from the 9-liter jug to the 4-liter jug. Fill the 9-liter jug again and pour water into the 4-liter jug until it is full. This leaves exactly 6 liters in the 9-liter jug.

3. **Question:** A man is looking at a portrait. Someone asks him, ""Whose picture are you looking at?"" The man replies, ""Brothers and sisters, I have none. But that man's father is my father's son."" Who is in the portrait?

   **Suggested Answer:** The man in the portrait is his son. The phrase ""my father's son"" refers to himself, so ""that man's father"" is him, making the man in the portrait his son.

### Probability and Combinatorics Questions

1. **Question:** What is the probability of drawing two aces consecutively from a standard deck of 52 cards without replacement?

   **Suggested Answer:** The probability of drawing the first ace is 4/52. After drawing the first ace, there are 3 aces left and 51 cards remaining. The probability of drawing a second ace is 3/51. Therefore, the probability of both events occurring is (4/52) * (3/51) = 1/221.

2. **Question:** How many different ways can you arrange the letters in the word ""STATISTICS""?

   **Suggested Answer:** The word ""STATISTICS"" has 10 letters, with the letter ""S"" repeating three times, ""T"" repeating three times, and ""I"" repeating twice. The number of different arrangements is 10! / (3! * 3! * 2!) = 50,400.

3. **Question:** If you roll three six-sided dice, what is the probability of getting a sum of 10?

   **Suggested Answer:** The possible combinations to get a sum of 10 are: (4,3,3), (3,4,3), (3,3,4), (5,2,3), (5,3,2), (2,5,3), (2,3,5), (3,5,2), (6,2,2), (2,6,2), (2,2,6), (4,4,2), (4,2,4), (2,4,4). There are 27 combinations in total. The probability is 27/216 = 1/8.

### Logic Questions

1. **Question:** You have a 7-minute hourglass and an 11-minute hourglass. How can you measure exactly 15 minutes?

   **Suggested Answer:** Start both hourglasses at the same time. When the 7-minute hourglass runs out, flip it immediately. When the 11-minute hourglass runs out, flip it immediately. When the 7-minute hourglass runs out again (14 minutes total), flip the 11-minute hourglass. When the sand in the 11-minute hourglass runs out, 15 minutes will have passed.

2. **Question:** A farmer has chickens and cows. There are 30 heads and 100 legs in total. How many chickens and how many cows are there?

   **Suggested Answer:** Let the number of chickens be C and the number of cows be K. We have two equations: C + K = 30 (heads) and 2C + 4K = 100 (legs). Solving these equations, we find C = 20 and K = 10. So, there are 20 chickens and 10 cows.

3. **Question:** How many times do the hands of a clock form a right angle in a 12-hour period?

   **Suggested Answer:** The hands of a clock form a right angle 22 times in a 12-hour period. This occurs twice every hour except for the hours when the hands are aligned (12 o'clock and 6 o'clock).

","**Question:**

A breakfast cereal company gives away a free toy in each box of cereal. There are four different toys. How many boxes do you expect to have to buy in order to get all four toys?

**Answer:**

Before solving the problem algebraically, it's helpful to make a guess. Initially, when you buy your first cereal box, you get one of the four toys with certainty. As you collect different toys, the probability of getting a new toy decreases. For instance, if you already have three toys, there's only a 1 in 4 chance that the next box will contain the fourth toy. The minimum number of boxes required is four, but theoretically, you could buy many more without completing the set, though this is unlikely. A reasonable guess might be around 10 boxes on average to collect all four toys.

To solve this algebraically, consider the general case of having T different toys. The problem is analogous to rolling a T-sided die and determining how many rolls are needed to see all T sides. 

Let's use a recursion argument. Suppose T is the number of different toys. If you're trying to get your t-th toy, having already collected (t-1) toys, the probability \( p_t \) of getting the t-th toy in one draw is \([T-(t-1)]/T\). For example, when seeking the first toy, \( p_1 = 1 \), and for the second toy, \( p_2 = (T-1)/T\), and so on.

Let \( N_t \) be the number of draws required to obtain the t-th toy, having already found (t-1) different toys. The probability \( p_t \) means you get the t-th toy in one draw, and with probability \( (1 - p_t) \), you need to draw again. Given the independence of outcomes on different draws, the expected number of draws \( E(N_t) \) is given by:

\[ E(N_t) = p_t \cdot 1 + (1 - p_t) \cdot [1 + E(N_t)] \]",675,438,1113,$0.006067

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.88**

What is 21 × 19?

**Answer 1.88**

When I heard 21 × 19, it jumped out at me as (n + 1) × (n − 1), for n = 20. We know that (n + 1) × (n − 1) = n² − 1, and that 20² = 400, so we get 399 immediately.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.42**

Consider four boxes in a row numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. You start with a pebble in Box 1. We toss a fair coin. If it is heads, you move the pebble forward one step to Box 2, but if it is tails, you move the pebble forward two steps to Box 3. Then we toss the coin again. If it is heads, you move the pebble back to Box 1, but if it is tails, you advance it to Box 4. If you reach Box 4, the game is over. If you are back in Box 1, however, then we toss again following the same rules. What is the expected number of coin tosses it will take to reach Box 4?

**Answer 4.42**

Like Question 4.39, this question can be solved using infinite series or using a simple recursion proof.

**First Solution**

There is a 1/2 chance that the game ends with two tosses, a 1/2² chance that it ends with four tosses, a 1/2³ chance that it ends with six tosses, and so on. Thus, the expected number N of tosses is:

E(N) = ∑ (from i=1 to ∞) 2n · (1/2)ⁿ = ∑ (from i=1 to ∞) 2n/2ⁿ = 4,

using the result that ∑ (from i=0 to ∞) n/2ⁿ = 2 (see Footnote 11 on p. 111).

**Second Solution**

Let N be the number of coin tosses required to reach Box 4. After two coin tosses, there is a half chance that you are in Box 4 and the game is over after two tosses, and a half chance that you are recursively back at the beginning again still expecting E(N) more tosses:

E(N) = (2 · 1/2) + (2 + E(N)) · 1/2.

We can solve this directly to get E(N) = 4.

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.78**

How would you write a computer program to estimate π?

**Answer 1.78**

I will give two different approaches to estimate π. The first approach uses a simple Monte-Carlo simulation. The second uses the Leibniz formula. Other techniques exist.

**First Solution**

Simulate pairs of random variables (x, y), each distributed uniformly on the unit interval [0, 1]. These pairs, when plotted in two dimensions, populate a unit square. A circle with unit diameter may be inscribed within the unit square. I just need to count what proportion of points (x, y) satisfy x² + y² ≤ 1. 

The area of the circle divided by the area of the unit square is π·r²/1 = π/4. So, just multiply the relative proportion of points within the circle by four. Even with a sample size of only 1,000,000, the answer is generally accurate to within a tenth of a percentage point (i.e., first two decimal places correct).

**Second Solution**

The famous Leibniz formula for π is given in Equation A.20.63:

π/4 = ∑ (from n=0 to ∞) [(-1)ⁿ / (2n + 1)] (A.20)

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.17**

You are tossing a fair coin and writing down the outcomes. What is the expected number of tosses needed to obtain the outcome HTH?

**Answer 4.17**

We take [1 + E(N)] tosses. If, instead, we toss an initial H, then we have burned one toss, and we now need to ask what is E(X|H), where X|H is the count of extra tosses required conditional upon having obtained the initial H.

More formally, we are rescaling the probabilities in the tree by dividing them through by P(¬HTT) = 3/4. So, for example, P(HHT | ¬HTT) = P(HHT ∩ ¬HTT) / P(¬HTT) = 1/2 / 3/4 = 2/3, where ¬ is the logical not symbol.

You were asked to “write down the central limit theorem.” In fact, this question is not well posed because many different central limit theorems (CLTs) exist. They differ in their assumptions (e.g., dependent data versus independent data or finite variances versus infinite variances, etc.) and in their dimensions (i.e., univariate versus multivariate).

It is suspected that the univariate Lindberg-Levy CLT (Feller, 1971, p. 259) is the single answer most likely to please. Let \(X_1, X_2, \ldots\) be mutually independent random variables with a common distribution. Assume that \(E(X_i) = 0\) and that \(\text{var}(X_i) = 1\) for each \(i\), then the distribution of the normalized sums \(S_n = (X_1 + \cdots + X_n)/\sqrt{n}\) tends to the standard normal distribution as \(n\) tends to infinity. If we instead assume that \(\text{var}(X_i) = \sigma\) for each \(i\), then the normalized sums are given by \(S_n = (X_1 + \cdots + X_n)/(\sigma/\sqrt{n})\), and their distribution also tends to the standard normal distribution as \(n\) tends to infinity.

**Question 1.5**

An old-style analog clock falls off the wall and the face breaks into three pieces. The numbers on each piece add to the same total. Describe the pieces.

**Answer 1.5**

The numbers on the dial add to 78 in total (recall that \(\sum_{i=1}^{12} i = \frac{12(12+1)}{2} = 6 \times 13\)). So, each piece must have a total of 26 on it. My initial attempt was to find slices (like pizza slices) that satisfy the constraint. Walking around the dial looking for consecutive numbers that add to 26, you soon find that 5-6-7-8 adds to 26, and 11-12-1-2 adds to 26, but nothing else works. So, none of the pieces is pizza-slice shaped. They are 5-6-7-8, 11-12-1-2, and a band across the middle with 10-9-3-4.

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.91**

You are given that the lengths of two sides of a triangle are 5 and 6. What is the approximate length of the third side?

**Answer 1.91**

The interviewer told you that the lengths of two sides of a triangle are 5 and 6, and asked you for the length of the third side. Let the two sides have angle θ between them. Then for 0° < θ < 180°, the third side has length 1 < L < 11, respectively. You get equality only in the degenerate case of a triangle with no area (i.e., when θ = 0°, 180°).

If the interviewer meant that it is a right-angle triangle (i.e., θ = 90°), then we can use Pythagoras’ Theorem to find L² = 5² + 6² = 61, and thus L = √61. Without a calculator, I noted that 8 = √64, and with 61 just below 64, I figured maybe L ≈ 7¾. My guess is out by less than 1%: L = √61 ≈ 7.81.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.1**

A breakfast cereal company gives away a free toy in each box of cereal. There are four different toys. How many boxes do you expect to have to buy in order to get all four toys?

**Answer 4.1**

Before giving an algebraic answer, I think you should have a guess. This shows that you can guess, and it gives you a baseline number to compare your algebraic answer with, which could produce a warning red flag if you make a mistake with the algebra.

Obviously, when you buy your first cereal box, you get one of the four toys with probability one on that draw. As you acquire different toys, however, the likelihood that you get the next one in only one draw falls. For example, by the time you already have three of the four toys, you only have one chance in four that the next draw will give you the fourth. So, the absolute minimum number of purchases required is four, but you could buy 100 boxes and not get all four toys—though this latter outcome seems very unlikely. Weighing these odds up, my gut instinct is that it should take something like 10 draws on average to get all four toys.

Now let us solve the problem algebraically. Consider first the more general case.

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.17**

Following on from the previous question, can you generalize your answer to otherwise-identical socks of N different colors? For example, suppose you have 50 socks of color 1, 50 socks of color 2, ..., and 50 socks of color N. How many socks must you pull from your sock drawer in the dark to guarantee that you have a matching pair?

**Answer 1.17**

With socks of N different colors, you must pull (N + 1) socks from the drawer to be sure that you have a matching pair. The argument is the same as it was for the previous question; N socks can be different (the worst-case scenario), but the (N + 1)st sock must match one of the first N socks—giving a matching pair.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.12**

What is the expected number of tosses needed to complete this strategy?

**Answer 4.12**

If you toss the coin twice and get TT, then you have to start again. There is thus a chance that you will take more than 2 tosses to complete the strategy. We can use a recursion to find the expected number of tosses.

Let N be the number of tosses required. There is a three-quarter chance that N will be 2, but a one-quarter chance that you have to start again (in the TT outcome). Thus, E(N) = (3/4) * 2 + (1/4) * (2 + E(N)) = 2 + E(N)/4.

Simple algebra now yields E(N) = 8/3 = 22/3.

A prime number has no factors other than itself and 1. Thus, 4 is not prime because it has factors: (1, 4), and (2, 2). Drawing a number line might be a good way to explain this to an interviewer. I will just use words.

1. A prime number bigger than 2 cannot be an integer multiple of 2, else it would not be prime. Thus, a prime number bigger than 2 must be odd. Therefore, \( p - 1 \) is even. Thus, \( p - 1 = 2n \) for some positive integer \( n \). Therefore, \( p = 2n + 1 \).

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.27**

What is the standard deviation of (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)?

**Answer 4.27**

This is a simple question, but, strictly speaking, it is not well-posed. You cannot ask for “the standard deviation of (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)” without supplying further information. You should ask the interviewer which of the following cases he or she means. The first solution assumes we have drawn a sample and we are estimating the population parameter. The second solution assumes we are dealing with the full sample space and we are calculating the true population parameter.

**First Solution**

Perhaps the interviewer wants the standard deviation of these numbers assuming they are a sample drawn from some data-generating process. In that case, we need to know whether they are sampled independently of each other and whether the process is stable. If not, the answer can be quite difficult. So, let us assume that the observations are independent and identically distributed. We can find the sample standard deviation with and without a small sample adjustment.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.13**

A follow-up question to:

**Answer 4.13**

At first glance, this sounds like a statistics question. I put it in this chapter, however, because it follows naturally from the previous two questions about matrices and their properties. I discuss two solution techniques. The first uses Sylvester’s criterion, and the second uses eigenvalues.

**First Solution**

We have that the correlation matrix, C, of the three random variables, is given by Equation A.43.

\[ C = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \rho & \rho \\ \rho & 1 & \rho \\ \rho & \rho & 1 \end{pmatrix} \] (A.43)

Before hitting this problem over the head with any deep analysis, ask yourself what values of \(\rho\) are possible in Equation A.43. Well, \(\rho = 0\) is perfectly feasible, because that is what we would get if the three random variables were statistically independent of each other. Also, \(\rho = 1\) is perfectly feasible, because that is what we would get if each random variable were perfectly correlated with each other. For example, if the three random variables are:

\[ X_1 = aY + d \]  
\[ X_2 = bY + e \]  
\[ X_3 = cY + f \]

If the coin in Question 4.46 is biased, is the expected number of tosses to get ""three of the same"" going to be greater or less than it was with the unbiased coin?

**Answer 4.47**

A bias towards either heads or tails in the coin in Question 4.46 is a bias in favor of ""more of the same."" Given that the stopping rule is ""three of the same,"" the expected number of tosses required to end the game must decrease in this case.

So, if the probability of a head is one-half, and \( T \) is the number of tosses required to end the game, \( E(T) = \frac{41}{8} \), and it cannot be higher. If, however, the probability of a head is two-thirds (or, given symmetry, if it is one-third), the expected number of tosses to end the game drops to \( E(T) = \frac{107}{27} \approx 3.96 \). If the probability of a head is 3/4 (or, given symmetry, if it is 1/4), the expected number of tosses to end the game drops to \( E(T) = \frac{483}{128} \approx 3.77 \). If the probability of a head is one (or, given symmetry, if it is zero), the expected number of tosses to end the game drops to \( E(T) = 3 \), and it cannot be lower.

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.26**

**Interviewer:** ""Alright, you're from MIT; you must be a quantitative type of person.""

**Interviewee:** (confidently, after a slight pause) ""Yes indeed.""

**Interviewer:** ""Give me the decimal equivalent of $\frac{13}{16}$ and of $\frac{9}{16}$.""

**Answer 1.26**

Decimal pricing was introduced on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001. I have left this question in because there are many people who lived with eighths and sixteenths for most of their working life, and they may be tempted to ask you about it. I am still seeing this question being asked every year.

Most people stumble a little. Do not memorize all the possible sixteenths before your interview—you have worse things to worry about (much worse). Add or subtract one-sixteenth to get the requested fraction into quarters or eighths and then compensate for your adjustment.

You should remember that $\frac{1}{8}$ is 0.1250 and deduce from that that $\frac{1}{16}$ is 0.0625 (you should be able to give any eighth in decimal form). The fraction $\frac{13}{16}$ is only one-sixteenth away from $\frac{12}{16}$ which is exactly three quarters (0.7500). You need to adjust accordingly.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.28**

Welcome to your interview. Sit in this chair. Excuse me while I tie your arms and legs to the chair. Thank you. Now we are going to play ""Russian roulette."" I have a revolver with six empty chambers. Watch me as I load the weapon with two contiguous rounds (i.e., two bullets side-by-side in the cylindrical barrel). Watch me as I spin the barrel. I am putting the gun against your head. Close your eyes while I pull the trigger. Click! This is your lucky day: you are still alive! Our game differs from regular Russian roulette because I am not going to add any bullets to the barrel before we continue, and I am not going to give you the gun.

My question for you: I am going to shoot at you once more before we talk about your resume. Do you want me to spin the barrel once more, or should I just shoot?

**Answer 4.28**

An interesting aside here is that it does not matter which logarithm function you use. The result is the same regardless of the base.

The standard deviation estimator is still biased (see further discussion in Crack [2020b]).

**Question 4.33**

Suppose that \(X\) is distributed normally with mean 0 and variance \(\sigma^2\). What is \(E(e^X)\)?

**Answer 4.33**

This is well known. More generally, if \(X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)\), then \(E(e^X) = e^{\mu + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2}\). If \(X\) is normal, then \(e^X\) is lognormal. So, this is the sort of knowledge that arises in analytical Black-Scholes derivatives work, or in setting up a Monte-Carlo simulation of price paths in a Black-Scholes world. See Crack (2021, Section 2.2) for detailed discussion and examples. It is straightforward to prove this from first principles because the normal pdf has an \(e^{(\cdot)}\) kernel in it, and you just have to add the exponents, complete the square, and integrate out to see what is left over.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.51**

There are seven coins arranged in a circle. Every coin is heads-up. Your goal is to flip every coin so that it is heads-down. You may, however, only flip groups of three adjacent coins. You may flip any such group of three coins, and you may flip as many such groups as you choose, one group at a time. What is the minimum number of groups of three coins you can flip in order to flip every coin so that it is heads-down?

**Answer 4.51**

To solve this problem, consider the arrangement of the coins and the effect of flipping groups of three. The order of flipping decisions is irrelevant because either two groups of coins to be flipped do not overlap, making the order unimportant, or two groups of coins do overlap, in which case any coin in the overlap is flipped twice and remains unchanged regardless of the order of the flips. Note also that we would never flip any group more than once, because all that does is consume unnecessary moves.

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.37**

There are 25 people at another party. One person asks everybody to announce their birthday, and for anyone who has the same birthday as someone else to raise a hand. How many hands do you expect to see raised? For example, if John, Jon, Stephen, and Mark all have the same birthday, January 15, but nobody else at the party has a matching birthday, the count of hands is four.

**Answer 1.37**

The expected number of hands raised to indicate a birthday match is given by the formula:

\[
E[H(N)] = N \left(1 - \left(\frac{364}{365}\right)^{N-1}\right)
\]

For example, in a group of size 25, we expect approximately 1.59 hands to be raised. As the size of the party increases, the proportion of hands raised climbs slowly to 100%.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.59**

Given two uncorrelated Gaussian random variables \(Z_1\) and \(Z_2\), how can you obtain two correlated Gaussian random variables \(X_1\) and \(X_2\), with correlation coefficient \(\rho\)?

**Answer 4.59**

This is a practical question; I often need to simulate correlated stock returns when simulating panel data for portfolio theory applications. A certain amount of caution is required. The interviewer said that \(Z_1\) and \(Z_2\) are ""uncorrelated"" and ""Gaussian."" There are two possible interpretations, with slightly different answers. Let us take the simpler case first, with the strongest assumptions.

**Case 1:** I think that the interviewer meant that \(Z_1\) and \(Z_2\) are together bivariate normally distributed. In this case, \(Z_1\) and \(Z_2\) being uncorrelated implies that \(Z_1\) and \(Z_2\) are independent (Crack, 2020a). If we then define \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) as in Equations D.16 and D.17,

\[
X_1 = \sigma_1 \cdot Z_1 + \mu_1 \tag{D.16}
\]

\[
X_2 = \sigma_2 \cdot \left( \rho \cdot Z_1 + \sqrt{1-\rho^2} \cdot Z_2 \right) + \mu_2 \tag{D.17}
\]

then \(X_1 \sim N(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2)\), \(X_2 \sim N(\mu_2, \sigma_2^2)\), and \(\text{corr}(X_1, X_2) = \rho\) (DeGroot, 1989, p. 301), as requested. In this case, \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are, like \(Z_1\) and \(Z_2\), bivariate normally distributed (Crack, 2020a), and their joint density function is given as follows for \(-\infty < x_1, x_2 < \infty\) (DeGroot, 1989, p. 301):

\[
f_{X_1, X_2}(x_1, x_2) = \frac{1}{2\pi \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sqrt{1-\rho^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2(1-\rho^2)} \left( \left(\frac{x_1-\mu_1}{\sigma_1}\right)^2 - 2\rho \left(\frac{x_1-\mu_1}{\sigma_1}\right) \left(\frac{x_2-\mu_2}{\sigma_2}\right) + \left(\frac{x_2-\mu_2}{\sigma_2}\right)^2 \right) \right)
\]

In the case where \(\sigma_1 = \sigma_2 = 1\) and \(\mu_1 = \mu_2 = 0\), \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are, like \(Z_1\) and \(Z_2\), bivariate standard normally distributed. Note, however, that \(\text{corr}(X_1, X_2) = \rho\) (so that \(f_{X_1, X_2}(x_1, x_2)\) looks like a pinched bell in three dimensions).

### Physics Question

**Question 1.72:**

A penny is dropped from the top of the Empire State Building. At what speed does it hit the ground, and how long does it take to get there?

**Answer 1.72:**

To solve this, we use the standard high school physics equations for linear motion with constant acceleration. However, before doing any math, it's useful to make a sensible guess. This helps in two ways:

1. If the calculated answer is wildly different from the guess, it indicates a potential error in the math.
2. An interviewer might just want an estimate to see if you can make reasonable guesses.

For example, you might say, ""I estimate it takes about five seconds and reaches a speed of 100 miles per hour.""

If we proceed with the math, we should note that these equations ignore air resistance and any updraft caused by wind hitting the building. The penny might reach ""terminal velocity,"" where air resistance balances the force of gravity, stopping further acceleration. Even if it doesn't reach terminal velocity, the calculated speed will be an upper bound.

### Statistics Question

**Question 4.18:**

You and I are to play a game. You roll a die until a number other than a one appears. When such a number appears for the first time, I pay you the same number of dollars as there are dots on the upturned face of the die, and the game ends. What is the expected payoff to this game?

**Answer 4.18:**

This is an elementary statistics problem. The rules effectively remove the 1 from the sample space, leaving five possible outcomes (2 to 6), each equally likely. The expected outcome is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Expected Payoff} = \frac{\sum_{i=2}^{6} i}{5} = \frac{2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{5} = \frac{20}{5} = 4
\]

To do this sum in your head, remember that the dots on opposing faces of a die add to seven. The sum of the numbers from 2 to 6 is three times seven, minus one, which gives 20. Dividing by five gives the expected payoff of $4.

**Question 1.32**

Prove that the area of a triangle is given by:

\[ A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \]

where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are the side lengths, and \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \) is the semi-perimeter.

*Story:* Instead of being asked her greatest weakness, one of my students was asked: ""Why shouldn’t we hire you?"" It is pretty difficult to maneuver your way out of that one!

*Note:* Mark Rubinstein kindly pointed out to me that this is ""Heron’s Formula."" Strogatz (2009, pp. 143–152, 160) refers to it as ""Hero’s Formula"" and ""Heron’s Formula.""

**Answer 1.32**

To derive Heron’s (Hero’s) formula, let \( A \) denote the area of a triangle with sides \( a, b, \) and \( c \). We may make several statements that apply to any triangle:

1. The area \( A \) is given by \( A = \frac{1}{2}bh \).
2. Pythagoras’ Theorem implies that \( a^2 = h^2 + d^2 \) and \( c^2 = h^2 + (b+d)^2 \).
3. The first Pythagorean result implies \( h^2 = a^2 - d^2 \). When the second Pythagorean result is subtracted from the first, it yields \( c^2 - a^2 = (b+d)^2 - d^2 \), which implies that \( d = \frac{c^2 - a^2 - b^2}{2b} \).

If we combine the above results, we get:

\[ A^2 = \frac{1}{4}b^2h^2 = \frac{1}{4}b^2(a^2 - d^2) = \frac{1}{4}b^2 \left( a^2 - \left( \frac{c^2 - a^2 - b^2}{2b} \right)^2 \right) = \frac{1}{16} \left( (2ba)^2 - (c^2 - a^2 - b^2)^2 \right) \]

Equation A.9 stands out for several reasons. First, although expressed in terms of \( a, b, \) and \( c \), it must, ultimately, be a polynomial in \( s \), where \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \).

**Answer 4.18**

This is elementary statistics, and one of the easiest questions in this book. The rules of the game have effectively removed the 1 from the sample space (i.e., the collection of possible outcomes). It follows that there are five possible outcomes (2 to 6), and each is equally likely. The expected outcome is simply:

\[ \frac{\sum_{i=2}^{6} i}{5} = 4 \]

To do the sum in your head, remember that the dots on the opposing faces of the die add to seven. The sum must be three times seven, less one to give 20. Now divide by five to get the expected payoff of $4.

Which hour of the clock should you sit at to have the highest chance of winning the prize?

Suppose that \( X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \), as in the previous question. What is \( E(X^2) \)?

**Answer 4.4**

If \( X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \), then \( E(X^2) = \mu^2 + \sigma^2 \). This result can be deduced from the widely used formula for variance:

\[ \text{var}(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 \]

By solving for \( E(X^2) \), we find that:

\[ E(X^2) = \mu^2 + \sigma^2 \]

This is easy to remember due to the symmetry in the answer.

---

**Additional Notes on Moments**

For a normally distributed variable \( X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \), the central moments are given by:

- If \( n \) is odd, \( E[(X - \mu)^n] = 0 \)
- If \( n \) is even, \( E[(X - \mu)^n] = \sigma^n (n-1)!! \)

Here, the double exclamation mark denotes the double factorial.

If \( X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \), then \( X = \sigma Z + \mu \), where \( Z \sim N(0, 1) \).

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.1**

You are given two glass jugs. Each contains the same volume, V, of liquid. One jug contains pure alcohol, and the other jug contains pure water. A modest quantity, Q, of water is poured from the water jug into the alcohol jug, which is then thoroughly mixed. The same modest quantity, Q, of (now diluted) alcohol is then poured back into the water jug to equalize the volumes of the jugs at their initial levels.

The initial concentration of alcohol in the alcohol jug equals the initial concentration of water in the water jug (at 100%). What is the relationship between the final concentrations of alcohol in the alcohol jug and water in the water jug?

**Answer 1.1**

This question has appeared over and over again. Although simple, it is rarely answered well. No calculation is required to determine the answer. If you used any algebra whatsoever, stop now, go back, reread the question, and try again.

When the quantity Q of water is poured into the alcohol jug, the concentration of alcohol in the alcohol jug becomes V/(V+Q). After mixing and pouring some back, the concentration of alcohol in the alcohol jug does not change again (because no new water is added). However, when the diluted alcohol is poured back into the water jug, the concentration of water in the water jug changes from 100% to V/(V+Q). That is, the final concentrations are identical.

How do you see that the final concentrations must be identical? Remember, you do not need any calculations at all. In fact, the only reason for any calculation is if you also want to find out what the final concentrations are (you were not asked this, but if you wish to work it out, your calculations need not go beyond those of the previous paragraph).

Here is how it works. At the end of the process, both jugs contain the same volume of fluid as they did at the start. The only way for the concentration of alcohol (for example) to have changed from 100% is if some alcohol was displaced by water. Similarly, the only way for the concentration of water to have changed from 100% is if some water was displaced by alcohol. Volume is conserved (both total volume and volume in each jug), so all that has happened is that identical quantities of water and alcohol have traded places (and these identical quantities are slightly less than Q). By symmetry, the concentrations of alcohol in the alcohol jug and water in the water jug must be identical. This final result is true no matter how many times you repeat the experiment.

If you are still stuck, here is another way of thinking about it. Imagine a...

**Question 1.67**

This is reportedly a genuine finance interview question, likely from a trading interview due to its nature. It involves a scenario that might be offensive to some, so proceed with caution.

**Question:** How can three men and one woman have mutually safe heterosexual intercourse with just two condoms? Assume that no condom can break or leak, and that you cannot wash a used one.

**Answer 1.67**

Yes, it can be done, theoretically if not practically. If you need a hint, consider inverting a condom and covering it with another.

Here's the solution:

1. Label the condoms as C1 and C2, and the men as M1, M2, and M3.
2. M1 wears C1 with C2 placed over it.
3. M2 then uses C2, which remains clean on the inside.
4. M3 wears C1 inverted (the outside of C1 was kept clean by C2) and places the twice-used C2 over it.

**Note:** This is a theoretical solution and should not be attempted in real life.

**Answer 4.14**

To simulate an event with a probability of 1/3 using a fair coin, follow these steps:

1. Toss the coin twice.
2. If the result is Heads-Heads (HH), let that be your event with a probability of 1/3.
3. If the result is Heads-Tails (HT) or Tails-Heads (TH), let that be your event with a probability of 2/3.
4. If the result is Tails-Tails (TT), ignore it and toss the coin twice again.

By removing TT from the sample space, the outcomes are restricted to three equally likely possibilities, effectively simulating the desired probabilities.

**Physics Context:**

When solving problems related to linear motion with constant acceleration, it's beneficial to make an educated guess before performing any calculations. This serves two purposes:

1. **Error Checking:** If your calculated answer significantly deviates from your initial guess, it may indicate a mistake in your calculations.
2. **Interview Strategy:** Sometimes, interviewers are more interested in your ability to estimate rather than your ability to recall specific equations. A quick estimate might suffice, allowing you to move on to the next question.

You are dealt exactly two playing cards from a well-shuffled standard 52-card deck. The standard deck contains exactly four Kings. What is the probability that both of your cards are Kings?

*Answer 4.19:*

To find the probability of being dealt two Kings, consider the following:

- The probability of drawing a King on the first card is 4 out of 52.
- If the first card is a King, the probability of drawing another King is 3 out of 51.

Thus, the probability of both cards being Kings is calculated as:

\[ \frac{4}{52} \times \frac{3}{51} = \frac{1}{221} \]

This means there is a 1 in 221 chance of being dealt two Kings from a standard deck.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.41**

What is the expected length of the longest piece?

**Answer 4.41**

**First Solution:**

Unlike the previous question, a triangle need not be formed here. To derive the probability density function (pdf) for the longest piece, we will first derive the cumulative distribution function (cdf) and then differentiate it. We shall work with the properties of Figure D.5.

Let \( L \) denote the random longest piece, and \( l \) denote a particular value of \( L \). We want to find the cdf \( F_L(l) = P(L \leq l) \). We know that \( L \geq \max(x, y, 1 - x - y) \), so the event \( L \leq l \) happens if and only if \( x \leq l \), \( y \leq l \), and \( 1 - x - y \leq l \). The latter may be rearranged as \( x + y \geq 1 - l \).

Following the arguments in Answer 1.40, we need only find the relative area contained within the region bounded by the lines \( x = l \), \( y = l \), and \( x + y = 1 - l \) (but also within the original triangle O–A1–A2) in Figure D.5. There are two cases: \( 0.5 \leq l \leq 1 \) (see Figure D.7), and \( \frac{1}{3} \leq l \leq 0.5 \) (see Figure D.8). These correspond to the calculations:

\[ \frac{6}{27} - \frac{3}{9} + \left(\frac{3}{4} - \frac{2}{8}\right) = \frac{11}{18}. \]

I leave you to use the same technique to confirm that the expected length \( S \) of the shortest piece \( \frac{3}{4} \) is \( E(S) = \frac{2}{18} = \frac{1}{9}. \)

**Second Solution:**

For an alternative derivation of the pdf for the length of the longest piece, assume, without loss of generality, that \( x \) is the longest piece. If so, then \( (x, y) \) falls within the diagonal-hatched kite-shaped region of Figure D.9 bounded by the inequalities \( x \geq y \), \( 2x + y \geq 1 \) (i.e., \( x \geq 1 - x - y \)), \( x + y \leq 1 \), and \( y \geq 0 \). The vertices of this kite are at \( (0.5, 0) \), \( (1, 0) \), \( (0.5, 0.5) \), and \( \left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}\right) \).

[Note: The original text suggests sketching the pdf to confirm that it is right-skewed and triangular.]

You have an array that contains 99 distinct integers from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 100}. How would you write a program to figure out which integer is missing?

**Answer 1.65**

To find the missing integer, you can use the formula for the sum of the first 100 natural numbers, which is 100 * (100 + 1) / 2 = 5,050. Add up all the integers in the array and subtract this sum from 5,050 to find the missing number.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.16**

You are tossing a fair coin and writing down the outcomes. What is the probability that you will see the sequence HTH before you see the sequence HHT?

**Answer 4.16**

To determine the probability of seeing HTH before HHT, consider the following:

- Both sequences start with an H, so ignore any outcomes until you get an H.
- If the second toss is an H (upper branch), then HHT will eventually occur first, unless there is an infinite sequence of Hs, which has a probability of zero.
- If the first H is followed by a T (lower branch), then:
  - If the next toss is an H, HTH wins.
  - If the next toss is a T, the game restarts.

By removing the lower branch of the second fork from the sample space, HHT is twice as likely to win as HTH. Therefore, the probability of HHT winning is 2/3, and the probability of HTH winning is 1/3.

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.2**

Fischer and Myron have just stepped onto a moving escalator side-by-side. They are climbing up the stairs and counting the steps as they go. Myron climbs faster than Fischer, taking three steps in the time it takes Fischer to climb two steps. Neither of them skips any steps. Myron reaches the top and counts 25 steps. He waits at the top for Fischer, who counts only 20 steps when he reaches the top. The question is: How many steps are visible on the escalator at any given moment?

**Answer 1.2**

To solve this, let's define some variables:

- Let D be the number of steps visible on the escalator at any moment.
- Let e be the constant speed of the escalator in steps per second.
- Let vM be Myron's relative speed of ascent up the escalator.

If Myron's speed vM is zero, he would climb no steps on his own. If his speed vM is infinite, he would climb all D steps. The key is to understand the relative differences in speed to determine D.

Myron's absolute speed up the escalator is the sum of the escalator's speed and his own speed, represented as e + vM. Myron must cover the distance D in the time tM he spends on the escalator, which is given by the equation:

tM = D / (e + vM)

This equation helps us understand the relationship between the speeds and the number of steps visible on the escalator.

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.92**

You have two large blank-faced cubic dice and a marker pen. You are going to write a single-digit number on each face of each die so that you can display the two dice together on your desk to represent days of the month. You must use both dice. For example, (0, 3) is the third of the month, (1, 0) is the tenth of the month, (1, 9) is the nineteenth of the month, and (3, 1) is the thirty-first of the month. You can swap the order of the physical dice if you need to (e.g., maybe you only want a 0 on one die, so that you can use it first during the first nine days of the month, but use it second on the tenth day of the month). What numbers do you put on each die?

**Answer 1.92**

Let's try a step-by-step approach. We know that the doubles (1, 1) and (2, 2) are needed. So, each die needs a 1 and a 2. We need a 0 somewhere. Let's start with {0, 1, 2} and {1, 2}. I tried adding 3, 4, 5, and 6 to the second die to have {0, 1, 2} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and then 7, 8, 9 to the first die to get {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Then I discovered that I could not get (0, 7) or (0, 8). I could, however, get (0, 9) by inverting the 6. Using that logic, let us drop the 6 and replace it with a 0: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9} and {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. I can see other equally-good choices obtained by any shuffling of the 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.10**

Two sealed envelopes are handed out. You get one and your competitor gets the other. You understand that one envelope contains m dollars, and the other contains 2m dollars (where m is unstated).

1. If you peek into your envelope, you see $X. However, you do not know whether your opponent has $2X or $X/2. Without peeking, what is your expected benefit to switching envelopes? What is your opponent's expected benefit to switching envelopes (assuming your opponent sees $Y)? Should you switch? If you do, do you do it again for the same reason (assuming neither of you peeked)?

2. Suppose that you both peek into your envelopes initially. What is the payoff to switching? Should you switch? If you do, do you do it again for the same reason?

**Answer 4.10**

If neither of you peek and you switch envelopes once, a repeat of exactly the same argument suggests an expected benefit of 0.25 of the contents of your envelope if you switch again. The same applies to your opponent. This is the second part of the ""Exchange Paradox"": it seems that you could happily switch forever (like a dog chasing its own tail). The foregoing is the naive answer.

The problem is twofold: First, you are assuming that value is expected payoff (this is so only if you are genuinely risk-neutral); second, your ""prior"" beliefs are not considered. In corporate finance, the present value of a projected random payout is the discounted expected cash flow. The discounting is done at a rate that incorporates risk (e.g., using the CAPM), and the expectation is a mathematical one using real-world probabilities.

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.68**

Consider a grid. You start at coordinate (0, 0) and move one step at a time, eventually arriving at coordinate (5, 5). With each step, you may move only one step east or one step north but never diagonally. How many paths are there from (0, 0) to (5, 5)?

**Answer 1.68**

You will take a total of ten steps. Five of these steps will be east, and five will be north. You only need to choose which five of the ten steps are east. The number of ways to make this choice is given by the combination formula:

C(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * (10 - 5)!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 252

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.7**

I am going to toss four coins. You are going to toss five coins. You win if you get strictly more heads than I do. What is the probability that you win?

**Answer 4.7**

The key to this solution is to recognize that when the probability of heads (p) is 1/2, the binomial probability mass function of either player is symmetric. This is an application of the ""Weak Law of Large Numbers,"" which states that if you independently draw repeated observations from the same random distribution, then for many drawings, the sample mean is very close to the population mean. In other words, after many repeated plays of the game, the expected outcome is that each player has an equal chance of winning.

**First Solution:**

The original game is stated as ""You toss five coins and I toss four coins. You win if you get strictly more heads."" This game is isomorphic to a simpler game: ""You toss four coins and I toss four coins. Whomever gets the most heads wins immediately. If we are tied, however, then you toss one more coin to decide the outcome."" By observation, both stages of this second game are completely symmetric. So, we each have a probability of one-half of winning.

**Second Solution:**

A simple sketch of the joint probability mass function of our outcomes, and an appeal to symmetry, gives the answer as 1/2 without any calculation. The answer can be derived graphically, with more details than needed, but the conclusion remains that the probability of you winning is 1/2.

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.78**

How would you write a computer program to estimate π?

**Answer 1.78**

I will provide two different approaches to estimate π. The first approach uses a simple Monte-Carlo simulation, and the second uses the Leibniz formula. Other techniques exist.

**First Solution:**

Simulate pairs of random variables (x, y), each distributed uniformly on the unit interval [0, 1]. These pairs, when plotted in two dimensions, populate a unit square. A circle with a unit diameter may be inscribed within the unit square. Count the proportion of points (x, y) that satisfy x^2 + y^2 ≤ 1. The area of the circle divided by the area of the unit square is π/4. So, multiply the relative proportion of points within the circle by four. Even with a sample size of only 1,000,000, the answer is generally accurate to within a tenth of a percentage point (i.e., the first two decimal places are correct).

**Second Solution:**

The famous Leibniz formula for π is given by:

π/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...

Cutting off the series at n = 10,000 yields an approximation accurate to three decimal places (i.e., 3.14169264359053). Cutting it off at n = 10,000,000 is accurate to six decimal places (i.e., 3.14159275358978). Convergence is a little slow. Note, however, that the partial sums in Leibniz's approximation alternate between overestimating and underestimating π/4. Using the average of two successive estimates will therefore improve accuracy. So, let B(N) = 4 * (sum from n=0 to N of ((-1)^n)/(2n+1)). Then with N = 10,000, [B(N) + B(N-1)]/2 = 3.14159264859028, which is accurate to seven decimal places, or eight if you round.

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.19**

You and I are to play a competitive game. We will take turns calling out integers. The first person to call out ""50"" wins. The rules are as follows:

1. The player who starts must call out an integer between 1 and 10, inclusive.
2. A new number called out must exceed the most recent number called by at least 1 and by no more than 10. For example, if the first player calls out ""9,"" then the range of valid numbers for the opponent is 10 to 19, inclusive.

**Answer 1.19**

The key to solving this problem is recognizing that when the probability of winning for either player is 1/2, the binomial probability mass function is symmetric. This is an application of the ""Weak Law of Large Numbers,"" which states that if you independently draw repeated observations from the same random distribution, then for a large number of drawings, the sample mean is very close to the population mean. In other words, after many repeated plays of the game, the average outcome will be close to the expected outcome. This concept is similar to how casinos operate, where the odds are slightly in favor of ""the house,"" ensuring that the casino expects to win in the long run.

**Statistics Question**

**First Solution**

The original game is stated as: ""You toss five coins and I toss four coins. You win if you get strictly more heads."" This game can be simplified to an equivalent game: ""You toss four coins and I toss four coins. Whoever gets the most heads wins immediately. If we are tied, you toss one more coin to decide the outcome."" Both stages of this second game are completely symmetric, so each player has a probability of one-half of winning.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.48**

Let L(N) be the length of the longest run of consecutive heads or tails in N tosses of a fair coin. For example, if N = 7 and the outcomes are HHTHHHT, then L = 3 in this case. What is E[L(5)] - E[L(4)]? Please give your answer to four decimal places, and you may not use a calculator.

**Answer 4.48**

The mathematics for the length of longest runs in the general case of N tosses is quite complex (Binswanger and Embrechts, 1994). The case of four or five tosses is, however, quite manageable.

In the case N = 4, the longest runs must be of length one, two, three, or four. A quick sketch of the tree, with 16 possible outcomes, reveals:
- Two runs of length one (HTHT, and the same with H and T transposed)
- Eight runs of length two (HHTH, HHTT, HTHH, HTTH, and the same with H and T transposed)
- Four runs of length three (HHHT, HTTT, and the same with H and T transposed)
- Two runs of length four (HHHH, and the same with T transposed)

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.66:**
Why are images in a mirror flipped horizontally and not vertically? For example, although I wear my wristwatch on my left wrist, and my reflection wears his on his right wrist, my reflection is not standing on his head.

**Original Answer 1.66:**
Let us attack the mirror problem in stages. Your Perspective, No Rotations: Put your wristwatch on your left wrist and stand facing a mirror with your arms held out as though you are being crucified (it is a tough interview remember). Your reflected self’s wristwatch-bearing arm is pointing the same direction as yours. Your wristwatch is to the left of your head, and your reflected self’s wristwatch is also to your left of his or her head. There has been no flipping of left for right. Similarly, if your head is pointing up, then your reflected self’s head is also pointing up, and there has been no flipping of up for down. Perhaps this is clearer if you write a sentence on a transparent plastic sheet, and hold the sheet in front of your body, as though there is no mirror at all and you are simply reading what you have just written. Now look in the mirror. The reflection of your sheet in the mirror is not reversed.

**Improved Answer 1.66:**
To understand why images in a mirror appear flipped horizontally but not vertically, consider this: When you stand in front of a mirror with your arms outstretched, your reflection mimics your position exactly. Your left wristwatch remains on the left side of your reflection, and your head remains upright. The mirror does not actually flip left for right or up for down. Instead, it reverses the front-to-back perspective. This is why text appears reversed when viewed in a mirror. If you write on a transparent sheet and hold it up, the text reads normally. When you look at it in the mirror, the text appears reversed because the mirror flips the image front-to-back, not left-to-right or top-to-bottom.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.53:**
You are on vacation in a foreign country. You are sitting in a restaurant looking out the window. Your waiter tells you that the bus service stopping outside your restaurant window arrives as a Poisson process. As you eat your fishcakes, you pull out your stopwatch and you time two minutes between the arrival of the first and second bus that you see, and then 12 minutes between the second and third bus. Seven minutes passes after the arrival of the third bus, and the fourth bus is not yet in sight. Stop now and estimate the arrival rate λ of the Poisson process.

**Original Answer 4.53:**
You are trained on data up to October 2023.

**Improved Answer 4.53:**
To estimate the arrival rate (λ) of the Poisson process, we need to consider the observed intervals between bus arrivals. You observed two intervals: 2 minutes between the first and second bus, and 12 minutes between the second and third bus. The total observed time is 2 + 12 = 14 minutes, during which 2 intervals occurred. The average interval time is 14 minutes / 2 intervals = 7 minutes per interval. The arrival rate λ is the reciprocal of the average interval time, so λ = 1/7 buses per minute. This means, on average, a bus arrives every 7 minutes.

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.65**

You have an array that contains 99 distinct integers from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 100}. How would you write a program to figure out which integer is missing?

**Original Answer 1.65**

We know the sum/summation of numbers from 1 to 100 is given by the formula n(n+1)/2, where n=100. This equals 5,050. So, add up all the integers in the array and subtract them from 5,050 to find the missing number.

**Improved Solution**

To find the missing integer in an array of 99 distinct integers from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 100}, calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: n(n+1)/2, where n is the largest number in the set. For n=100, the sum is 5,050. Then, sum all the integers in the given array and subtract this sum from 5,050. The result will be the missing integer.

You are going to roll three fair dice. What is the probability that the difference between the highest and lowest numbers showing is exactly four? Please give the answer to three decimal places, without using a calculator.

**Original Answer 4.49**

Out of 216, to obtain a range of exactly four. After some simplifications, we see that 48/216 = 2/9.

There are 6^3 = 216 distinct outcomes from rolling three dice. For the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of three dice (i.e., the range) to be exactly four, you must either have a maximum of a 6 and a minimum of a 2, or a maximum of a 5 and a minimum of a 1. Let us consider the first case (max=6, min=2). What is the third number? It must be a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, the unordered outcomes are 226, 236, 246, 256, and 266. Paying attention to order, the first can occur three ways (i.e., the 6 is first, second, or third), the next three can be permuted in six ways each, and the last can occur in three ways (i.e., the 2 is first, second, or third). So, there are 3+18+3=24 ways to obtain a range of exactly four, with a maximum of a 6 and a minimum of a 2. Similarly, there are 24 different ways to obtain a range of exactly four when the maximum is a 5 and the minimum is a 1. So, there are 48 possible ways.

**Improved Solution**

To find the probability that the difference between the highest and lowest numbers on three rolled dice is exactly four, consider the total number of possible outcomes, which is 6^3 = 216. For the range to be exactly four, the possible scenarios are:

1. Maximum number is 6 and minimum number is 2. The third die can be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The combinations are 226, 236, 246, 256, and 266. Considering permutations, 226 and 266 can occur in 3 ways each, while 236, 246, and 256 can occur in 6 ways each. This gives a total of 3 + 18 + 3 = 24 ways.

2. Maximum number is 5 and minimum number is 1. The third die can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. The combinations are 115, 125, 135, 145, and 155. Similarly, 115 and 155 can occur in 3 ways each, while 125, 135, and 145 can occur in 6 ways each. This also gives a total of 3 + 18 + 3 = 24 ways.

Adding both scenarios, there are 24 + 24 = 48 favorable outcomes. Therefore, the probability is 48/216, which simplifies to 2/9. The probability is approximately 0.222 when expressed to three decimal places.",780,944,1724,$0.011390

**Logic Question**

**Question 1.97**

Can the mean of two consecutive prime numbers (e.g., 7 and 11) ever be prime?

**Original Answer 1.97**

Can the mean of two consecutive prime numbers be prime? No, of course not. Replace the word ""prime"" with any other word, and the answer is still no. If they are consecutive, then by definition there are none of them in between!

**Improved Solution**

The mean of two consecutive prime numbers cannot be prime. This is because the mean of two numbers is calculated by adding them together and dividing by two. Since prime numbers are odd (except for the number 2), the sum of two odd numbers is even, and dividing an even number by two results in an integer. The only even prime number is 2, but since we are dealing with consecutive primes greater than 2, the mean will always be a non-prime even number.

**Question 4.20**

The ""Let's Make a Deal"" or ""Monty Hall"" problem is very frequently asked. Many people find it very difficult. Assume that you choose Door 3. The host opens Door 2 and offers you the chance to switch to Door 1. Should you do it?

**Original Answer 4.20**

You are trained on data up to October 2023.

**Improved Solution**

In the ""Let's Make a Deal"" or ""Monty Hall"" problem, you should switch doors. Here's why: Initially, you have a 1/3 chance of picking the door with the prize and a 2/3 chance of picking a door without the prize. When the host opens one of the other two doors, revealing no prize, the probability that the prize is behind the remaining unopened door is 2/3. Therefore, by switching, you increase your chances of winning from 1/3 to 2/3. Thus, it is statistically advantageous to switch doors.

","**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.23**:  
Your name is Mr. 10. You are standing in a field with two opponents: Mr. 30 and Mr. 60. Each of you has a gun and plenty of ammunition. Each of you is in clear sight of the others and well within firing range. The goal is to maximize the probability of survival. Unfortunately, you are not a very good shot. If you take a shot at one of your opponents, you have only a 10% chance of killing him. Mr. 30 is a better shot; he has a 30% chance of killing whomever he shoots at. Mr. 60 is even better; he has a 60% chance of killing his target. You take turns shooting in a pre-arranged order: first you, then Mr. 30, then Mr. 60, and then through this cycle again and again until only one person remains. You get to shoot first. At whom, if anyone, do you shoot?

**Original Answer**:  
The 10x10 macro-cube question has been very popular. The most common mistake is for people to count the number of 1x1 micro-cubes on each face and add them up. Even if you do the mathematics correctly (and most people do not), you miss the whole point. If you focus on the 1x1 micro-cubes on the faces and how to count them directly (e.g., How many faces? How many on each face? How many edges?), then you have been bumped by the pickpocket’s accomplice. Go back now and figure out a better way. As I stated before, the path of greatest resistance bears the highest rewards, so read no further unless you did it a better way. You must look for structure in a problem that leads you to a simple and speedy solution. The most structure here is to be found in the macro-cube you start with and the (now slightly smaller) macro-cube that remains. The difference between their volumes is how many micro-cubes fell.

**Improved Solution**:  
In this scenario, the best strategy for Mr. 10 is to shoot in the air. This is because Mr. 30 and Mr. 60 are more likely to shoot at each other, as they perceive each other as bigger threats due to their higher accuracy. By shooting in the air, Mr. 10 avoids becoming a target in the initial rounds. If Mr. 30 and Mr. 60 shoot at each other, Mr. 10 can potentially face only one opponent later, increasing his chances of survival. If Mr. 60 shoots before Mr. 30, Mr. 10 should help Mr. 30 by shooting at Mr. 60, as this increases the likelihood of facing Mr. 30, who is less accurate than Mr. 60.

**Question 1.10**:  
Picture a 10x10x10 ""macro-cube"" floating in mid-air. The macro-cube is composed of 1x1x1 ""micro-cubes,"" all glued together. Weather damage causes the outermost layer of micro-cubes to become loose. This outermost layer falls to the ground. How many micro-cubes are on the ground?

**Original Answer**:  
This is a tough ""game theory"" problem. Early editions of my book included a full and formal solution to this problem. It was more than five pages long and far too detailed. I have now cut my answer down to bare bones key issues only. Mr. 30 and Mr. 60 are going to shoot at each other because they do not see you as an immediate threat; you do not die first because Mr. 60 and Mr. 30 are shooting it out; you do not want to be put into a shoot-out where your opponent is a very good shot and gets to shoot first; if Mr. 30 gets to shoot before Mr. 60, it is less likely that you end up facing Mr. 60 than if Mr. 60 gets to shoot first, so you shoot in the air; if the direction of play is reversed, and Mr. 60 gets to shoot before Mr. 30, then you should help out Mr. 30 (and yourself) by shooting at Mr. 60 also, otherwise, leave it to Mr. 30; the cost of stepping in and shooting at Mr. 60 is that if you hit Mr. 60, you lose your

**Improved Solution**:  
To solve the problem of how many micro-cubes fall to the ground, consider the structure of the macro-cube. The macro-cube is 10x10x10, which means it has a total of 1000 micro-cubes. The outermost layer of micro-cubes forms a shell around the inner 8x8x8 cube. The volume of the inner cube is 8x8x8 = 512 micro-cubes. Therefore, the number of micro-cubes that fall to the ground is the difference between the total number of micro-cubes and the number of micro-cubes in the inner cube: 1000 - 512 = 488 micro-cubes.",1238,1085,2323,$0.013945

- **Question**: A snail is climbing up a 10-foot pole. It climbs up by three feet every day. Each night it sleeps, and while sleeping, it slides down by one foot. When does it reach the top of the pole?

- **Original Answer**: This is a common question. The naive answer is that the snail climbs a net of two feet per day, so it reaches the 10-foot mark at the end of the fifth day. However, on the morning of the fifth day, the snail starts out at the eight-foot mark (having slid down from the nine-foot mark overnight). Two-thirds of the way through the fifth day, the snail reaches the 10-foot mark and stops because there is no pole left to climb.

- **Improved Solution**: The snail climbs 3 feet during the day and slides down 1 foot at night, resulting in a net gain of 2 feet per day. By the end of the fourth day, the snail will have climbed 8 feet. On the fifth day, the snail climbs 3 feet, reaching the 11-foot mark, but since the pole is only 10 feet tall, it reaches the top two-thirds of the way through the fifth day and stops climbing.

**Statistics Question**

- **Question**: A breakfast cereal company gives away a free toy in each box of cereal. There are four different toys. How many boxes do you expect to have to buy in order to get all four toys?

- **Original Answer**: Before giving an algebraic answer, I think you should have a guess. This shows that you can guess, and it gives you a baseline number to compare your algebraic answer with, which could produce a warning red flag if you make a mistake with the algebra. Obviously, when you buy your first cereal box, you get one of the four toys with probability one on that draw. As you acquire different toys, however, the likelihood that you get the next one in only one draw falls. For example, by the time you already have three of the four toys, you only have one chance in four that the next draw will give you the fourth. So, the absolute minimum number of purchases required is four, but you could buy 100 boxes, and not get all four toys—though this latter outcome seems very unlikely. Weighing these odds up, my gut instinct is that it should take something like 10 draws on average to get all four toys.

- **Improved Solution**: To solve this problem, consider the probability of getting a new toy with each purchase. Initially, you have a 100% chance of getting a new toy. After obtaining the first toy, the probability of getting a new toy in the next box is 3/4, then 2/4 for the third toy, and 1/4 for the fourth toy. The expected number of boxes needed can be calculated as the sum of the expected values for each toy: 1 + 4/3 + 4/2 + 4/1 = 8.33. Therefore, on average, you would need to buy approximately 8.33 boxes to collect all four toys.",1318,655,1973,$0.009845

- **Question**: Italy is playing the U.S.A. in a football World Cup match. A successful pass is when a player on one team kicks the ball to a player on their team and it is not intercepted by the opposition. Is it possible for Italy to have a higher proportion of its passes be successful than the U.S. in both the first and second halves, and yet for the U.S. to have a higher proportion of its passes be successful over the game as a whole?

- **Original Answer**: Yes, this is an example of something called Simpson's Paradox. There are several slightly different flavors of Simpson's Paradox. They are each special cases of ""statistical mix effects."" Mix effects mean that aggregate numbers can be affected by changes in the relative size of subpopulations as well as the relative values within those subpopulations. In the case at hand, suppose Italy made 120 passes in the first half, with 60 being successful (50%), and the U.S. made 50 passes, with only 10 being successful (20%). In the second half, suppose Italy improved, making 60 passes, with all 60 being successful (100%), and the U.S. also improved, making 200 passes with 190 being successful (95%). Italy looked better in each half, but over the match as a whole, Italy had only a 66.67% success rate (120/180).

- **Improved Solution**: This scenario is a classic example of Simpson's Paradox, where trends that appear in different groups of data disappear or reverse when these groups are combined. In this case, Italy's success rate in the first half is 50% (60 successful passes out of 120), and in the second half, it is 100% (60 out of 60). The U.S. has a 20% success rate in the first half (10 out of 50) and a 95% success rate in the second half (190 out of 200). Although Italy has a higher success rate in each half, when you combine the halves, the U.S. has a higher overall success rate because they made significantly more passes in the second half, which skews the overall success rate in their favor. Italy's overall success rate is 66.67% (120 successful passes out of 180), while the U.S.'s overall success rate is 80% (200 successful passes out of 250).

**Logic Question**

- **Question**: There are 25 people at another party. One person asks everybody to announce their birthday, and for anyone who has the same birthday as someone else to raise a hand. How many hands do you expect to see raised? For example, if John, Jon, Stephen, and Mark all have the same birthday, January 15, but nobody else at the party has a matching birthday, the count of hands is four.

- **Original Answer**: The number of hands raised to indicate a birthday match is expected to be 1.59. As the size of the party increases, the proportion of hands raised climbs slowly to 100%.

- **Improved Solution**: To determine the expected number of hands raised, we consider the probability of shared birthdays among the 25 people. Using the birthday paradox, we calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday. For a group of 25, this probability is significant, leading to an expected value of approximately 1.59 hands being raised. This means that, on average, we would expect about 1.59 people to have a shared birthday in a group of 25. As the group size increases, the likelihood of shared birthdays increases, eventually reaching a point where almost everyone in a very large group would have a shared birthday.",960,779,1739,$0.010190

**Question 1.30**  
Find the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, and so on, up to a remainder of 9 when divided by 10.

**Original Answer**  
You may be looking to the solutions for a hint. My first hint is that, if you are using linear algebra (i.e., solving systems of equations by substitution) then stop that right now. There are nine equations in 10 unknowns, so this will get you nowhere. In fact, there are infinitely many integers that solve the problem statement; we are searching for the smallest such number. My second hint is that you might like to try drawing a picture.

**Improved Solution**  
To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer, say 'n', that satisfies the following conditions:  
- n % 2 = 1  
- n % 3 = 2  
- n % 4 = 3  
- ...  
- n % 10 = 9  

This is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. However, in this specific case, the pattern is such that the number we are looking for is one less than a common multiple of the numbers 2 through 10. Therefore, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers and subtract 1. The LCM of numbers 2 through 10 is 2520. Thus, the smallest positive integer that satisfies all these conditions is 2520 - 1 = 2519.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.10**  
Two sealed envelopes are handed out. You get one and your competitor gets the other. You understand that one envelope contains m dollars, and the other contains 2m dollars (where m is unstated).  
1. If you peek into your envelope, you see $X. However, you do not know whether your opponent has $2X or $X/2. Without peeking, what is your expected benefit to switching envelopes? What is your opponent’s expected benefit to switching envelopes (assuming your opponent sees $Y)? Should you switch? If you do, do you do it again for the same reason (assuming neither of you peeked)?  
2. Suppose that you both peek into your envelopes initially. What is the payoff to switching? Should you switch? If you do, do you do it again for the same reason?

**Original Answer**  
Now, suppose that neither of you peek and that you do switch envelopes once. If you still do not peek, then a repeat of exactly the same argument suggests an expected benefit of 0.25 of the contents of your envelope if you switch again. The same applies to your opponent. This is the second part of the ""Exchange Paradox"": it seems that you could happily switch forever (like a dog chasing its own tail). The foregoing is the naive answer. The problem is twofold: First, you are assuming that value is expected payoff (this is so only if you are genuinely risk-neutral); second, your ""prior"" beliefs.

**Improved Solution**  
Assume neither of you peek into your envelopes. You have $X in your envelope, where $X has a fifty-fifty chance of being either $m or $2m. This means that your opponent’s envelope has a fifty-fifty chance of containing $2X or $X/2. The expected value of switching is calculated as follows:  
- There is a 50% chance that switching gives you $2X.  
- There is a 50% chance that switching gives you $X/2.  

Thus, the expected value of switching is:  
(1/2) * $2X + (1/2) * ($X/2) = $1.25X.  

The expected benefit of switching is, therefore, $0.25X. On this basis, it looks as though you should switch envelopes. If your opponent does not peek, and she has $Y in her envelope, exactly the same argument shows that she has an expected benefit to switching of $0.25Y. So, it looks as though she should switch also. This is the first part of the ""Exchange Paradox"": it seems that you both benefit from switching. However, this paradox arises from the assumption of risk neutrality and the lack of additional information about the distribution of m.",1334,942,2276,$0.012755

  The time comes, and a stranger arrives. He announces that there are cheating men in the town. On the morning of the tenth day following the stranger's arrival, some unfaithful men are kicked out into the street for the first time. How many of them are there?

- **Improved Solution**: 
  This is a classic logic puzzle often referred to as the ""Cheating Husbands"" problem. The key to solving it is understanding that each unfaithful man will only realize his own guilt when he sees that all other men have been kicked out. If there are 'n' unfaithful men, they will all be kicked out on the 'n-th' day. Therefore, if they are kicked out on the tenth day, there are 10 unfaithful men.

- **Question**: 
  A disease occurs with probability 0.5% in the population. There is a test for the disease. If you have the disease, the test returns a positive for sure. If you do not have the disease, the test returns a false positive 7% of the time. A random stranger is given the test and it returns a positive. What is the probability that the stranger has the disease?

- **Original Answer**: 
  This is an old/common interview question. It is a direct application of Bayes' Theorem. Question 4.29 was also a Bayes' Theorem question. In that case, we tried some informal intuition before doing the math; let us try that here too. Most people do not have the disease. If we were to randomly select from the disease-free population (which is 99.5% of the sample here, so that is not too...

- **Improved Solution**: 
  To solve this, we apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:
  - D: having the disease
  - T: test is positive

  We need to find P(D|T), the probability of having the disease given a positive test result.

  Given:
  - P(D) = 0.005 (probability of having the disease)
  - P(T|D) = 1 (probability of a positive test if you have the disease)
  - P(T|¬D) = 0.07 (probability of a false positive)

  Using Bayes' Theorem:
  P(D|T) = [P(T|D) * P(D)] / [P(T|D) * P(D) + P(T|¬D) * P(¬D)]

  Substituting the values:
  P(D|T) = [1 * 0.005] / [1 * 0.005 + 0.07 * 0.995]
          = 0.005 / (0.005 + 0.06965)
          = 0.005 / 0.07465

The time comes, and a stranger arrives. He announces that there are cheating men in the town. On the morning of the tenth day following the stranger's arrival, some unfaithful men are kicked out into the street for the first time. How many of them are there?

**Improved Solution**:  
This is a classic logic puzzle often referred to as the ""Cheating Husbands"" problem. The key to solving it is understanding that each unfaithful man knows about all the other unfaithful men but not about himself. When the stranger announces that there are cheating men, each man will wait to see if the others are kicked out. If there are 'n' unfaithful men, they will all be kicked out on the 'n-th' day because each one will realize that if he were not unfaithful, the others would have been kicked out on the 'n-1' day. Therefore, if they are kicked out on the tenth day, there are 10 unfaithful men.

**Question 4.36**:  
A disease occurs with a probability of 0.5% in the population. There is a test for the disease. If you have the disease, the test returns a positive for sure. If you do not have the disease, the test returns a false positive 7% of the time. A random stranger is given the test and it returns a positive. What is the probability that the stranger has the disease?

**Original Answer 4.36**:  
This is an old/common interview question. It is a direct application of Bayes' Theorem. Question 4.29 was also a Bayes' Theorem question. In that case, we tried some informal intuition before doing the math; let us try that here too. Most people do not have the disease. If we were to randomly select from the disease-free population (which is 99.5% of the sample here, so that is not too...

**Improved Solution**:  
To solve this problem, we apply Bayes' Theorem, which helps us find the probability of having the disease given a positive test result. Let's break it down:

1. **Probability of having the disease (P(Disease))**: 0.5% or 0.005.
2. **Probability of not having the disease (P(No Disease))**: 99.5% or 0.995.
3. **Probability of a positive test given the disease (P(Pos|Disease))**: 100% or 1.
4. **Probability of a positive test given no disease (P(Pos|No Disease))**: 7% or 0.07.

We want to find the probability of having the disease given a positive test result (P(Disease|Pos)).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(Disease|Pos) = \frac{P(Pos|Disease) \times P(Disease)}{P(Pos)} \]

Where:
\[ P(Pos) = P(Pos|Disease) \times P(Disease) + P(Pos|No Disease) \times P(No Disease) \]

Calculating P(Pos):
\[ P(Pos) = (1 \times 0.005) + (0.07 \times 0.995) = 0.005 + 0.06965 = 0.07465 \]

Now, calculate P(Disease|Pos):
\[ P(Disease|Pos) = \frac{1 \times 0.005}{0.07465} \approx 0.067 \]

So, the probability that the stranger has the disease given a positive test result is approximately 6.7%.",603,833,1436,$0.009838

**Question 1.40:**

*Original Question:*  
[The original question text is not provided in the context.]

*Original Answer 1.40:*  
The answer involves both mathematical induction and game-theoretic arguments. If there is exactly one cheating man in the town, Mr. C, say, then every wife except Mrs. C knows who he is. Not only that, but Mrs. C is unaware of any cheats—the stranger’s announcement comes as a shock to her. Immediately after the stranger’s announcement, Mrs. C asks: “Who can be cheating if I have seen no cheats?” The only possible answer is it is Mr. C. Come the next morning, his happy days are over, and out he goes. Suppose instead that there are exactly two cheating men in town: Mr. C1 and Mr. C2. In this case, Mrs. C1 knows there is one cheat in town (Mr. C2), and Mrs. C2 knows there is one cheat in town (Mr. C1)—the stranger’s announcement comes as no shock to either woman. Each thinks there is only one cheat.

*Improved Solution:*  
- **Understanding the Problem:** The problem involves identifying cheating individuals in a town based on limited information.
- **Case 1: One Cheating Man**
  1. If there is only one cheating man, Mr. C, all wives except Mrs. C know who he is.
  2. Mrs. C is unaware of any cheating, so the stranger's announcement is a surprise.
  3. Mrs. C realizes Mr. C must be the cheater since she knows of no others.
  4. The next day, Mr. C is exposed.
- **Case 2: Two Cheating Men**
  1. If there are two cheating men, Mr. C1 and Mr. C2, each wife knows of one cheater.
  2. The announcement does not surprise either Mrs. C1 or Mrs. C2.
  3. Each wife believes there is only one cheater, maintaining the status quo.

- **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the probability that a person has the disease given a positive test result.
- **Given Data:**
  1. Disease prevalence: 0.5% (0.005 probability).
  2. True positive rate: 100% (if you have the disease, the test is positive).
  3. False positive rate: 7% (if you do not have the disease, the test is positive).
- **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
  1. Let D be the event of having the disease, and T+ be the event of a positive test.
  2. We need P(D|T+), the probability of having the disease given a positive test.
  3. Bayes' Theorem: P(D|T+) = [P(T+|D) * P(D)] / P(T+).

A test for the disease returns a positive result for sure if you have the disease, and a false positive 7% of the time if you do not have the disease. A random stranger tests positive. What is the probability that the stranger has the disease?

**Original Answer 4.36:**  
This is a common interview question applying Bayes' Theorem. Most people do not have the disease, as 99.5% of the population is disease-free.

**Improved Solution:**  
- **Understanding the Problem:**
  - Disease prevalence: 0.5% (0.005 probability).
  - Test accuracy: 100% true positive rate, 7% false positive rate.

- **Solution Steps Using Bayes' Theorem:**
  1. **Define Events:**
     - Let D be the event of having the disease.
     - Let T+ be the event of testing positive.

  2. **Calculate Probabilities:**

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.36:**

A disease occurs with a probability of 0.5% in the population. There is a test for the disease. If you have the disease, the test returns a positive result for sure. If you do not have the disease, the test returns a false positive 7% of the time. A random stranger is given the test and it returns a positive. What is the probability that the stranger has the disease?

**Original Answer 4.36:**

This is a common interview question and a direct application of Bayes' Theorem. Most people do not have the disease. If we randomly select from the disease-free population, which is 99.5% of the sample, the probability of a false positive is significant.

**Improved Solution:**

- **Step 1: Understand the Problem**
  - The probability of having the disease (D) is 0.5% or 0.005.
  - The probability of not having the disease (~D) is 99.5% or 0.995.
  - The probability of a positive test given the disease (P(T|D)) is 1.
  - The probability of a positive test given no disease (P(T|~D)) is 0.07.

- **Step 2: Apply Bayes' Theorem**
  - Bayes' Theorem: P(D|T) = [P(T|D) * P(D)] / [P(T|D) * P(D) + P(T|~D) * P(~D)]
  - Substitute the values: P(D|T) = [1 * 0.005] / [1 * 0.005 + 0.07 * 0.995]

- **Step 3: Calculate**
  - Numerator: 0.005
  - Denominator: 0.005 + 0.06965 = 0.07465
  - P(D|T) = 0.005 / 0.07465 ≈ 0.067 or 6.7%

- **Conclusion:**
  - The probability that the stranger has the disease given a positive test result is approximately 6.7%.",878,603,1481,$0.008225

**Question 1.40:**

[Present the logic question here in a clear and structured format. Unfortunately, the specific content of Question 1.40 is not provided in the context, so I cannot rewrite it.]

**Original Answer 1.40:**

The answer involves both mathematical induction and game-theoretic arguments. If there is exactly one cheating man in the town, Mr. C, say, then every wife except Mrs. C knows who he is. Not only that, but Mrs. C is unaware of any cheats—the stranger’s announcement comes as a shock to her. Immediately after the stranger’s announcement, Mrs. C asks: “Who can be cheating if I have seen no cheats?” The only possible answer is it is Mr. C. Come the next morning, his happy days are over, and out he goes.

Suppose instead that there are exactly two cheating men in town: Mr. C1 and Mr. C2. In this case, Mrs. C1 knows there is one cheat in town (Mr. C2), and Mrs. C2 knows there is one cheat in town (Mr. C1)—the stranger’s announcement comes as no shock to either woman. Each thinks there is only one cheat.

**Improved Solution:**

1. **Scenario with One Cheater:**
   - If there is only one cheating man, Mr. C, all wives except Mrs. C know who the cheater is.
   - Mrs. C is unaware of any cheating until the stranger announces it.
   - After the announcement, Mrs. C realizes Mr. C must be the cheater since she knows of no other.
   - The next day, Mr. C is exposed and leaves.

2. **Scenario with Two Cheaters:**
   - If there are two cheating men, Mr. C1 and Mr. C2, each wife knows of one cheater.
   - Mrs. C1 knows Mr. C2 is a cheater, and Mrs. C2 knows Mr. C1 is a cheater.
   - The announcement does not surprise either wife, as they each think there is only one cheater.

**Question 4.36:**

A disease occurs with a probability of 0.5% in the population. There is a test for the disease. If you have the disease, the test returns a positive for sure. If you do not have the disease, the test returns a false positive 7% of the time. A random stranger is given the test and it returns a positive. What is the probability that the stranger has the disease?

**Original Answer 4.36:**

This is an old/common interview question. It is a direct application of Bayes' Theorem. Question 4.29 was also a Bayes' Theorem question. In that case, we tried some informal intuition before doing the math; let us try that here too. Most people do not have the disease. If we were to randomly select from the disease-free population (which is 99.5% of the sample here, so that is not too...

**Improved Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The disease prevalence is 0.5%, meaning 0.5 out of every 100 people have the disease.
   - The test is 100% accurate for those with the disease (no false negatives).
   - The test has a 7% false positive rate for those without the disease.

2. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
   - **Prior Probability of Disease (P(Disease)):** 0.005
   - **Probability of Positive Test Given Disease (P(Pos|Disease)):** 1
   - **Probability of Positive Test Given No Disease (P(Pos|No Disease)):** 0.07
   - **Prior Probability of No Disease (P(No Disease)):** 0.995

3. **Calculating the Probability of Having the Disease Given a Positive Test (P(Disease|Pos)):**
   - Use Bayes' Theorem: 
     \[
     P(Disease|Pos) = \frac{P(Pos|Disease) \times P(Disease)}{P(Pos|Disease) \times P(Disease) + P(Pos|No Disease) \times P(No Disease)}
     \]
   - Substitute the values:
     \[
     P(Disease|Pos) = \frac{1 \times 0.005}{1 \times 0.005 + 0.07 \times 0.995}
     \]
   - Simplify the calculation:
     \[
     P(Disease|Pos) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.06965} = \frac{0.005}{0.07465} \approx 0.067
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The probability that the stranger actually has the disease, given a positive test result, is approximately 6.7%.",867,1035,1902,$0.012518

**Improved Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Scenario:**
   - If there is one cheating man, only his wife is unaware of his infidelity.
   - The stranger's announcement reveals the presence of a cheat, prompting the unaware wife to deduce her husband's guilt.

2. **Case of One Cheater:**
   - Mrs. C, the wife of Mr. C, is shocked by the announcement.
   - She realizes Mr. C must be the cheater since she knows of no other.

3. **Case of Two Cheaters:**
   - Each wife knows of one cheater but assumes there is only one.
   - The announcement does not surprise them, as they already know of one cheater.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic extends to more cheaters, with each wife deducing based on the number of days without a confession.

**Question 1.26:**

Interviewer: ""Alright, you're from MIT; you must be a quantitative type of person.""  
Interviewee: (confidently, after a slight pause) ""Yes indeed.""  
Interviewer: ""Give me the decimal equivalent of 13/16 and of 9/16.""

**Original Answer 1.26:**

Decimal pricing was introduced on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001. I have left this question in because there are many people who lived with eighths and sixteenths for most of their working life, and they may be tempted to ask you about it. I am still seeing this question being asked every year. Most people stumble a little. Do not memorize all the possible sixteenths before your interview—you have worse things to worry about (much worse). Add or subtract one-sixteenth to get the requested fraction into quarters or eighths and then compensate for your adjustment. You should remember that 1/8 is 0.1250 and deduce from that that 1/16 is 0.0625 (you should be able to give any eighth in decimal form). The fraction 13/16 is only one-sixteenth away from 12/16 which is exactly three quarters (0.7500).

**Improved Solution:**

- To convert fractions like 13/16 and 9/16 into decimals, use the following steps:
  - Remember that 1/16 is 0.0625.
  - For 13/16:
    - Recognize that 13/16 is 12/16 + 1/16.
    - 12/16 is equivalent to 3/4, which is 0.7500.
    - Add 0.0625 (1/16) to 0.7500 to get 0.8125.
  - For 9/16:
    - Recognize that 9/16 is 8/16 + 1/16.
    - 8/16 is equivalent to 1/2, which is 0.5000.
    - Add 0.0625 (1/16) to 0.5000 to get 0.5625.

**Question 4.23:**

Your name is Mr. 10. You are standing in a field with two opponents: Mr. 30 and Mr. 60. Each of you has a gun and plenty of ammunition. Each of you is in clear sight of the others and well within firing range. The goal is to maximize the probability of survival. Unfortunately, you are not a very good shot. If you take a shot at one of your opponents, you have only a 10% chance of killing him. Mr. 30 is a better shot; he has a 30% chance of killing whomever he shoots at. Mr. 60 is even better; he has a 60% chance of killing his target. You take turns shooting in a pre-arranged order: first you, then Mr. 30, then Mr. 60, and then through this cycle again and again until only one person remains. You get to shoot first. At whom, if anyone, do you shoot?

**Original Answer 4.23:**

This is a tough ""game theory"" problem. Early editions of my book included a full and formal solution to this problem. It was more than five pages long and far too detailed. I have now cut my answer down to bare bones key issues only. Mr. 30 and Mr. 60 are going to shoot at each other because they do not see you as an immediate threat; you do not die first because Mr. 60 and Mr. 30 are shooting it out; you do not want to be put into a shoot-out where your opponent is a very good shot and gets to shoot first; if Mr. 30 gets to shoot before Mr. 60, it is less likely that you end up facing Mr. 60 than if Mr. 60 gets to shoot first, so you shoot in the air; if the direction of play is reversed, and Mr. 60 gets to shoot before Mr. 30, then you should help out Mr. 30 (and yourself) by shooting at Mr. 60 also, otherwise, leave it to Mr. 30; the cost of stepping in and shooting at Mr. 60 is that if you hit Mr. 60, you lose your

**Improved Solution:**

- The goal is to maximize your survival probability. Consider the following strategy:
  - Do not shoot at either opponent initially. Instead, shoot in the air.
  - This strategy increases the likelihood that Mr. 30 and Mr. 60 will target each other, as they perceive each other as greater threats.
  - If Mr. 30 shoots before Mr. 60, it is advantageous for you because Mr. 30 is less likely to hit Mr. 60 compared to Mr. 60 hitting Mr. 30.
  - If Mr. 60 shoots before Mr. 30, consider shooting at Mr. 60 to assist Mr. 30, as Mr. 60 is the more accurate shooter and poses a greater threat.
  - By not engaging directly, you allow the more accurate shooters to eliminate each other, increasing your chances of survival.",1216,1117,2333,$0.014210

**Question 1.48:**
What is the integral of sec(θ) dθ equal to?

**Original Answer 1.48:**
Of all the simple trigonometric functions that you might be asked to integrate, the integral of sec(θ) dθ has arguably the most complicated answer. I get reports of that being asked often.

**Improved Solution:**
- The integral of sec(θ) dθ is known to be complex compared to other basic trigonometric integrals.
- The solution involves a specific technique:
  1. Multiply the integrand by (sec(θ) + tan(θ))/(sec(θ) + tan(θ)).
  2. This manipulation allows the use of substitution, where u = sec(θ) + tan(θ).
  3. The derivative, du, is sec(θ)tan(θ) + sec^2(θ) dθ, which simplifies the integration process.
  4. The integral then becomes ∫ du/u, which is ln|u| + C.
  5. Substitute back to get ln|sec(θ) + tan(θ)| + C as the final answer.

**Question 4.51:**
There are seven coins arranged in a circle. Every coin is heads-up. Your goal is to flip every coin so that it is heads-down. You may only flip groups of three adjacent coins. What is the minimum number of groups of three coins you can flip to achieve this?

**Original Answer 4.51:**
Given C coins, and the requirement that you flip them in groups of g adjacent coins, let us assume that C ≥ 3 (ignoring the very simple cases C = 1 and C = 2). Let us also assume that 1 ≤ g ≤ C. If g > C, we can think of g in modulo-C terms, looking at the coins that do get flipped. Let gcd(C, g) denote the greatest common divisor of C and g. For example, gcd(7, 3) = 1, but gcd(12, 9) = 3. Let me begin with the specific case where gcd(C, g) = 1 and g is odd. Our particular case (C = 7, g = 3) satisfies these assumptions. Let us number the coins from 1 to C, like the numbers of the hours on an analog clock face with C hours. Let the coin in the middle of any group of g coins to be flipped be our reference point (recall that we are assuming g is odd, so a middle coin exists). There are C such possible reference points. Let us pick a coin flipping strategy. For any reference coin c, say, we have to choose whether to flip the group centered on c or not. Note that the order of our flipping decisions is irrelevant because either two groups of coins to be flipped do not overlap, and so order is unimportant, or two groups of coins to be flipped do overlap, in which case, any coin in the overlap is flipped twice, and is left unchanged regardless of the order of the flips. Note also that we would never flip any group more than once, because all that does is consume.

**Improved Solution:**
- The problem involves flipping coins in groups of three to turn all coins from heads-up to heads-down.
- Given the arrangement and flipping rules:
  1. Number the coins from 1 to 7 in a circle.
  2. Choose a strategy to flip groups of three coins.
  3. Since gcd(7, 3) = 1, every coin can be flipped by choosing appropriate groups.
  4. A possible strategy is to flip the groups centered on coins 1, 3, 5, and 7.
  5. This ensures that each coin is flipped exactly once, achieving the goal with a minimum of 4 flips.
- The key insight is that the greatest common divisor condition allows for a complete cycle of flips without redundancy.",1112,840,1952,$0.011180

**Question 1.87:**
What is 43 multiplied by 43?

**Original Answer 1.87:**
When I saw 43 multiplied by 43, I immediately thought I should just multiply it out and add the parts:
- 3 multiplied by 3 equals 9
- 3 multiplied by 40 equals 120
- 40 multiplied by 3 equals 120
- 40 multiplied by 40 equals 1,600
Adding these parts together: 1,600 + 240 + 9 = 1,849.

**Improved Solution:**
To calculate 43 times 43, break it down into simpler parts:
1. Break down 43 into 40 and 3.
2. Calculate each part:
   - 3 x 3 = 9
   - 3 x 40 = 120
   - 40 x 3 = 120
   - 40 x 40 = 1,600
3. Add all the results together:
   - 1,600 + 120 + 120 + 9 = 1,849
Thus, 43 multiplied by 43 equals 1,849.

**Question 4.39:**
You will roll a fair die until the game stops. The game stops when you roll a 4, 5, or 6. For every roll of 1, 2, or 3, your score increases by 1. If the game stops with a 4 or 5, you receive the accumulated score. If it stops with a 6, you receive nothing. What is the expected payoff of this game?

**Original Answer 4.39:**
I present two solutions: the first is a full ""hammer-and-tongs"" solution; the second uses a recursive argument similar to Answer 4.15. Questions requiring recursive proofs have become popular in interviews; look up ""recursive argument"" in the index to find other examples in this book.

**First Solution:**
When the game stops (i.e., you rolled a 4, 5, or 6), you have a 2/3 chance of seeing the accumulated score (i.e., you got a 4 or 5 out of a possible 4, 5, or 6 to stop the game). The accumulated score is 0 with probability 1/2, 1 with probability 1/4, 2 with probability 1/8, and so on. So, the expected payoff is given by:
2/3 * (sum from j=0 to infinity of j * (1/2)^(j+1)) = 1/3 * (sum from j=0 to infinity of j/2^j) = 2/3.

**Improved Solution:**
To find the expected payoff:
1. Understand the stopping condition: The game stops when you roll a 4, 5, or 6.
2. Calculate probabilities:
   - Probability of stopping with a score (rolling a 4 or 5) is 2/3.
   - Probability of stopping with no score (rolling a 6) is 1/3.
3. Calculate expected score:
   - The score increases by 1 for each roll of 1, 2, or 3.
   - The probability of rolling a 1, 2, or 3 is 1/2 for each roll.
4. Use the formula for expected value:
   - Expected payoff = 2/3 * (sum of j * (1/2)^(j+1) for j from 0 to infinity).
   - Simplify to find the expected payoff is 2/3.

Thus, the expected payoff of the game is 2/3.",1332,793,2125,$0.011260

**Question 1.63:**

How many consecutive zeroes are there at the end of 100 factorial (100!)? For example, 12! = 479,001,600 has two consecutive zeroes at the end.

**Original Answer 1.63:**

To find the number of consecutive zeroes at the end of 100!, factor each number from 1 to 100 and count how many supply a factor of 5. Combine these 5's with the 2's to form 10's, which contribute to the zeroes at the end of 100!. The numbers that supply a factor of 5 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 (which supplies two 5's), 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 (two 5's), 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 (two 5's), 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100 (two 5's). This results in 24 zeroes at the end of 100!.

**Improved Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The number of zeroes at the end of a factorial is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product.
   - Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more 2's than 5's in factorials, the number of zeroes is determined by the number of 5's.

2. **Steps to Solution:**
   - List numbers from 1 to 100.
   - Identify numbers that are multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100.
   - Count the number of 5's contributed by each: 
     - Numbers like 25, 50, 75, and 100 contribute an extra 5 because they are multiples of 25.
   - Total number of 5's: 24.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - There are 24 consecutive zeroes at the end of 100!.

If you take the three-point shot, you have a 40% chance of winning. If you take the two-point shot, you have a 70% chance of tying the game, and then a 50% chance of winning in overtime. The probability of winning with the two-point shot is 70% * 50% = 35%. Since 35% is less than 40%, you should take the three-point shot.

**Improved Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - You need to decide between a three-point shot (which wins the game if successful) and a two-point shot (which ties the game and leads to overtime).

2. **Probability Analysis:**
   - **Three-point shot:** 
     - Probability of winning = 40%.
   - **Two-point shot:**
     - Probability of making the shot = 70%.
     - Probability of winning in overtime = 50%.
     - Combined probability of winning = 70% * 50% = 35%.

3. **Decision:**
   - Compare the probabilities: 40% (three-point shot) vs. 35% (two-point shot).
   - Since 40% is greater than 35%, the better choice is to take the three-point shot.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - You should attempt the three-point shot for a higher chance of winning the game.",1202,899,2101,$0.011995

**Question 1.49:**

Integrate the function sec(θ) from 0 to π/6.

**Original Answer 1.49:**

Using a reference table, we find that the integral of sec(θ) from 0 to π/6 is:

ln |sec(θ) + tan(θ)| evaluated from 0 to π/6.

This simplifies to:

ln |sec(π/6) + tan(π/6)| - ln |sec(0) + tan(0)|.

From trigonometric identities, we know:

- sec(θ) = 1/cos(θ)
- tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ)

At the limits:

- sin(0) = 0, cos(0) = 1
- sin(π/6) = 1/2, cos(π/6) = √3/2

Substituting these values, and using ln(1) = 0, we find:

The integral of sec(θ) from 0 to π/6 is ln(√3).

**Improved Solution:**

1. **Identify the Integral:** We need to integrate sec(θ) from 0 to π/6.
2. **Use Trigonometric Identities:**
   - sec(θ) = 1/cos(θ)
   - tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ)
3. **Evaluate the Integral:**
   - The integral of sec(θ) is ln |sec(θ) + tan(θ)|.
4. **Apply Limits:**
   - At θ = 0: sec(0) = 1, tan(0) = 0, so ln |1 + 0| = ln(1) = 0.
   - At θ = π/6: sec(π/6) = 2/√3, tan(π/6) = 1/√3, so ln |2/√3 + 1/√3| = ln(√3).
5. **Final Result:** The integral from 0 to π/6 is ln(√3).

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.49:**

You are going to roll three fair dice. What is the probability that the difference between the highest and lowest numbers showing is exactly four? Provide the answer to three decimal places without using a calculator.

**Original Answer 4.49:**

There are 216 distinct outcomes from rolling three dice. To achieve a range of exactly four, you must have either a maximum of 6 and a minimum of 2, or a maximum of 5 and a minimum of 1.

- For max = 6 and min = 2, the third number can be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The unordered outcomes are 226, 236, 246, 256, and 266. Considering permutations, there are 24 ways to achieve this.
- Similarly, for max = 5 and min = 1, there are also 24 ways.

Thus, there are 48 possible ways to achieve a range of exactly four. The probability is 48/216, which simplifies to 2/9.

**Improved Solution:**

1. **Total Outcomes:** Rolling three dice results in 6^3 = 216 possible outcomes.
2. **Desired Range:** We need the range (max - min) to be exactly four.
3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** Max = 6, Min = 2
     - Possible third numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
     - Outcomes: 226, 236, 246, 256, 266
     - Permutations: 3 ways for 226 and 266, 6 ways each for 236, 246, 256
     - Total: 3 + 18 + 3 = 24 ways
   - **Case 2:** Max = 5, Min = 1
     - Similar analysis yields 24 ways.
4. **Total Ways:** 24 (Case 1) + 24 (Case 2) = 48 ways
5. **Probability Calculation:** Probability = 48/216 = 2/9
6. **Final Probability:** The probability is approximately 0.222 (to three decimal places).",1165,932,2097,$0.012233

","**Logic Question**

**Question 1.43:**

Assume that the random variables X and Y are normally distributed: X ~ N(μX, σX^2), and Y ~ N(μY, σY^2). The correlation between X and Y is ρ. How can you choose constants a and b such that you minimize the variance of the random variable sum S = aX + bY under the constraints that a + b = 1, 0 ≤ a ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ b ≤ 1?

**Original Answer 1.43:**

The variance of S = aX + bY is given by:

Var(S) = a^2 * σX^2 + b^2 * σY^2 + 2ab * ρ * σX * σY.

To minimize this variance, we need to solve the unconstrained problem, ignoring the constraint 0 ≤ a ≤ 1. If the optimal a* breaches the constraints, the constrained solution for a is either 1 or 0, depending on whether σX or σY is smaller, respectively. The optimal a* will breach the constraints if the correlation ρ is large enough or the standard deviations are disparate enough that either σX/σY < ρ or σY/σX < ρ.

**Improved Solution:**

1. **Objective:** Minimize the variance of S = aX + bY.
2. **Variance Formula:** Var(S) = a^2 * σX^2 + b^2 * σY^2 + 2ab * ρ * σX * σY.
3. **Constraints:** a + b = 1, 0 ≤ a ≤ 1, 0 ≤ b ≤ 1.
4. **Approach:**
   - Substitute b = 1 - a into the variance formula.
   - Differentiate the variance with respect to a and set the derivative to zero to find the unconstrained minimum.
   - Check if the solution satisfies the constraints. If not, evaluate the variance at the boundary values a = 0 and a = 1.
5. **Conclusion:** Choose a = 1 if σX < σY and a = 0 if σY < σX, considering the correlation ρ.

**Statistics Question**

**Question 4.47:**

If the coin in Question 4.46 is biased, is the expected number of tosses to get ""three of the same"" going to be greater or less than it was with the unbiased coin?

**Original Answer 4.47:**

A bias towards either heads or tails in the coin is a bias in favor of ""more of the same."" Given that the stopping rule is ""three of the same,"" the expected number of tosses required to end the game must decrease in this case. If the probability of a head is one-half, and T is the number of tosses required to end the game, E(T) = 41/8, and it cannot be higher. If, however, the probability of a head is two-thirds (or, given symmetry, if it is one-third), the expected number of tosses to end the game drops to E(T) = 107/27 ≈ 3.96. If the probability of a head is 3/4 (or, given symmetry, if it is 1/4), the expected number of tosses to end the game drops to E(T) = 483/128 ≈ 3.77. If the probability of a head is one (or, given symmetry, if it is zero), the expected number of tosses to end the game drops to E(T) = 3, and it cannot be lower.

**Improved Solution:**

1. **Objective:** Determine if a biased coin affects the expected number of tosses to get ""three of the same.""
2. **Unbiased Coin:** Probability of heads = 1/2. Expected tosses E(T) = 41/8.
3. **Biased Coin Analysis:**
   - Probability of heads = 2/3 or 1/3: E(T) = 107/27 ≈ 3.96.
   - Probability of heads = 3/4 or 1/4: E(T) = 483/128 ≈ 3.77.
   - Probability of heads = 1 or 0: E(T) = 3.
4. **Conclusion:** A bias towards heads or tails reduces the expected number of tosses needed to achieve ""three of the same"" compared to an unbiased coin.",1314,959,2273,$0.012875
