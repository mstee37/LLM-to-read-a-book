Answer 1.1,"This question has appeared over and over again. Although simple,
it is rarely answered well. No calculation is required to determine the answer.
If you used anyalgebra whatsoever, stop now, go back, reread the question,
and try again.
When the quantity Qof water is poured into the alcohol jug, the concentration
of alcohol in the alcohol jug becomesV
V+Q.A f t e r m i x i n g a n d p o u r i n g s o m e
back, the concentration of alcohol in the alcohol jug does not change again
(because no new water is added). However, when the diluted alcohol is poured
back into the water jug, the concentration of water in the water jug changes
from 100% toV
V+Q.T h a ti s ,t h eﬁ n a lc o n c e n t r a t i o n sa r ei d e n t i c a l .
How do you see that the ﬁnal concentrations must be identical? Remember,
you do not need any calculations at all. In fact, the only reason for any
calculation is if you also want to ﬁnd out what the ﬁnal concentrations are
(you were not asked this, but if you wish to work it out, your calculations need
not go beyond those of the previous paragraph).
Here is how it works. At the end of the process, both jugs contain the same
volume of ﬂuid as they did at the start. The only way for the concentration
of alcohol (for example) to have changed from 100% is if some alcohol was
displaced by water. Similarly, the only way for the concentration of water to
have changed from 100% is if some water was displaced by alcohol. Volume is
conserved (both total volume and volume in each jug), so all that has happened
is that identical quantities of water and alcohol have traded places (and these
identical quantities are slightly less than Q). By symmetry, the concentrations
of alcohol in the alcohol jug and water in the water jug must be identical. This
ﬁnal result is true no matter how many times you repeat the experiment.
If you are still stuck, here is another way of thinking about it. Imagine a
black bucket with 1,000 black marbles in it and a white bucket with 1,000

Answer 1.2,"I give three successively shorter solutions. The ﬁrst is a hammer-
and-tongs solution that lays everything out in detail. The second is more
elegant, and the third is more elegant still. Each solution brings something
slightly diﬀerent to the table.
FIRST SOLUT ION
LetDbe the number of steps showing on the escalator at any moment ( D
for distance, counted in units of one step). Let ebe the (assumed constant)
speed of the escalator, in steps per second. Let vMbe Myron’s relative speed
of ascent up the escalator (which is the same whether the steps are moving or
not). If vM= 0, then Myron will climb zero steps under his own steam. If
vM=∞,t h e nM y r o nw i l lc l i m b Dsteps. So, it will be the relative diﬀerences
in speed that let us identify D.
Myron’s absolute speed up the incline holding the escalator is e+vM.S o ,
Myron must cover the distance Din time tM, spent on the escalator, as given
by Equation A.1.
tM=D/(e+vM) (A.1)
How many steps does Myron climb in time tM?W e l l , a t s p e e d vM,w ej u s t
need to multiply time taken by speed, as in Equation A.2.
steps climbed (Myron) = tM·vM=DvM/(e+vM) (A.2)
We should double check that the RHS of Equation A.2 conforms to our intu-
ition. If we plug vM= 0 into Equation A.2 we get zero steps, as expected, for
anye>0. Similarly, if we take the limit of Equation A.2 as vM→∞,w eg e t

Now let vFdenote Fischer’s slower speed, where 2 vM=3vF.T h e n , f r o m
Equation A.2 and the relative speeds, we have Equations A.3–A.5.
steps climbed (Myron) = 25 = DvM/(e+vM) (A.3)
steps climbed (Fischer) = 20 = DvF/(e+vF) (A.4)
2vM=3 vF (A.5)

Answer 1.3,"If you answered 20 (i.e., 4 ×5) minutes, then go back to the ques-
tion and think again. You need to be hardwired to ignore such “pickpocket
answers” (see story on p. 286).
Although not stated, we should assume the bells ring at equal spaced intervals.
If one bell rings ﬁve times per minute, then that is every 12 seconds. The other,
at four times per minute, rings every 15 seconds. They will next ring together
at the 60 second mark. The answer is one minute.

a major bank before being ushered into an interview with a female manager.
He sat across from her, put his feet on her desk and said, ‘Get me a Coke. ’ ”

Answer 1.4,"This is a very common question, and a very simple one. You need
to ﬁgure out the sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + ···+ 99 + 100. There are several ways to do
this.
FIRST SOLUT ION

second and second-to-last terms also add to 101. The same is true of the third

previous row, you get the array including both the diagonal and the lower-
triangular oﬀ-diagonal. Were the array full, it would contain 100 ×100 = 1002
marbles. So, your answer must be roughly half this (roughly 50 ×100). This
is not exact because although the array contains two triangular-shaped oﬀ-
diagonals (upper and lower), there is only one diagonal. If you add another
diagonal, and then split the total in two, you get the right answer. The diagonal
contains 100 marbles, so the right answer must be1002+100

Answer 1.5,"The numbers on the dial add to 78 in total (recall that/summ⎬tiontext12
i=1=
12(12+1)
2=6×13). So, each piece must have a total of 26 on it. My initial
attempt was to ﬁnd slices (like pizza slices) that satisfy the constraint. Walking
around the dial looking for consecutive numbers that add to 26, you soon ﬁnd
that 5-6-7-8 adds to 26, and 11-12-1-2 adds to 26, but nothing else works. So,
none of the pieces is pizza-slice shaped. They are 5-6-7-8, 11-12-1-2, and a
band across the middle with 10-9-3-4."
Answer 1.6,"This challenging question has been very popular. Sometimes it is
balls, sometimes marbles, sometimes coins. I present two solutions.3
FIRST SOLUT ION4
Let me write, say, 1Hif marble 1 is heavy or potentially heavy (it should be
clear by the context), but if it cannot be light. Similarly, let me write 1Lif
marble 1 is light or potentially light, but if it cannot be heavy. Using this
notation, the 12 marbles yield 24 diﬀerent possible outcomes, because each
marble may be heavy or light, relative to its peers:
1H 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H 10H 11H 12H
1L 2L 3L 4L 5L 6L 7L 8L 9L 10L 11L 12L.
Split the 12 marbles into three groups: Let these be, say, marbles 1–4, marbles
5–8, and marbles 9–12. Compare marbles {1234 }(in the ﬁrst dish) with
marbles {5678 }(in the second dish). There are three cases, as follows.
Case 1: The ﬁrst dish is heavy. In this case, we have reduced the 24 possible
outcomes to only eight possible outcomes, as indicated:
1H 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H 10H 11H 12H
1L 2L 3L 4L 5L 6L 7L 8L 9L 10L 11L 12L.
3One of my readers, who tried this at home, said that the methods given here, while successful
in theory, would not work in practice. He said he would need to add the use of a marker pen to
the problem statement to keep track of which marble was which when swapping marbles between
the dishes on the balance.

Answer 1.7,"I have drawn a right-angle triangle on Figure A.1 using R,t h e
radius of the circle. Once we solve for R,t h es i d el e n g t hi s S=2R.
From Figure A.1 we deduce that R2=(R−10)2+(R−5)2(via Pythagoras’

Answer 1.8,"You (the bug) cannot ﬂy; you have to walk. You must ﬁnd the
shortest path from corner to corner.
In any world, the shortest path between two points is called a “geodesic. ” On
a spherical world (e.g., the Earth’s surface), a geodesic is an arc of a “great
circle. ” A great circle is a circle on the surface of the sphere with diameter
equal to the diameter of the sphere. For example, airplanes typically follow
great circles above the Earth (because it is the shortest path and, therefore,
the most fuel-eﬃcient path).
Like a spherical world, the cubic-room world has a two dimensional surface.
However, the lack of curvature in the cubic-room world means that the shortest
distance between two points must be a straight line rather than an arc of a
great circle (in a world without curvature, geodesics are straight lines).
If the cubic room is opened up and ﬂattened out it can be seen that the shortest
path is a straight line from one corner to the other. In the un-ﬂattened room,
this straight line corresponds to two line segments that meet exactly halfway
up one wall-ﬂoor or wall-wall boundary. Direct computation using Pythagoras’
Theorem10reveals that the total path length is√
5u n i t s .
10In this case, the path is the hypotenuse of a triangle of side lengths 2 and 1 in the ﬂattened-out
room or two hypotenuses of triangles each of side lengths 1 and1
2in the un-ﬂattened room. In
either case, the path is of total length√

Answer 1.9,"People tend to overlook the brilliantly simple situation described.
If you did any mathematics whatsoever, you probably missed the point.
No calculation is needed to see that at each stage an equal number of male
babies and female babies are expected to be born. The proportions of male
and female children are, therefore, expected to remain equal at 50%.
Still stuck? Here are the details (standing at t=0a n dl o o k i n ga te x p e c t e d
outcomes only): by the end of the ﬁrst year, the 100,000 families have 50,000
boys and 50,000 girls. The proportion of male children stands at 50%. By the
end of the second year, half of the 100,000 families (the ones without a son)
have another child. This adds 25,000 boys and 25,000 girls. There are now
75,000 boys and 75,000 girls. The proportion of male children still stands at
50%. There are still 25,000 families without a son. They add another 12,500
boys and an equal number of girls, and so on.
Some people are tempted to suppose that because all large families have many
daughters and a single son, there must be more girls than boys. However,
there are not many large families.11"
Answer 1.10,"The 10 ×10 macro-cube question has been very popular. The most
common mistake is for people to count the number of 1 ×1 micro-cubes on
each face and add them up. Even if you do the mathematics correctly (and
most people do not), you miss the whole point.
If you focus on the 1 ×1m i c r o - c u b e so nt h ef a c e sa n dh o wt oc o u n tt h e m
directly (e.g., How many faces? How many on each face? How many edges?),
then you have been bumped by the pickpocket’s accomplice (see story on
p. 286). Go back now and ﬁgure out a better way. As I stated before, the
path of greatest resistance bears the highest rewards, so read no further unless
you did it a better way.
You must look for structure in a problem that leads you to a simple and speedy
solution. The most structure here is to be found in the macro-cube you start

Answer 1.11,"If not for the ability to stop and dump apples along the way,
you could not deliver any apples at all.12So, the key is to make repeated
trips where you dump apples in a pile at the side of the road and then you
subsequently pick up and deliver apples from that apple dump. For example,
suppose you made three trips where each time you left City A with 1,000
apples and dumped 500 uneaten apples at the 500-mile marker. You would
then have accumulated 1,500 apples at the 500-mile marker and you could
deliver 500 of those to City B (e.g., in one trip of 1,000 apples where 500 are
delivered uneaten, and 500 are left to rot at 500-mile marker).
To ﬁnd the optimal strategy, we must put some bounds on what is sensible.
If you are driving away from City A, or away from an apple dump at the side
of the road, then if there are 1,000 or more apples available, it would never
make sense to leave with fewer than 1,000 apples on the truck. For example,
suppose your very ﬁrst move was to drive away from City A with only 900
apples. Well, no matter where you dump the uneaten balance, you missed
out on giving an extra 100 apples a free ride to that spot, and that must be
suboptimal. So, we should drive away from City A only three times, with
1,000 apples on board each time.
The next question is whether, for any one of these three departures from
City A, we dump the uneaten apples at only one apple dump, or whether we
dump them at more than one location. Suppose on one trip we dump 100
apples at the 100-mile marker, and then the uneaten balance at some later
spot. That cannot be sensible, because again, no matter where you dump the
uneaten balance, you missed out on giving an extra 100 apples a free ride to
that spot. So, we must choose a single dump location for each run.
Could dump locations diﬀer by run? Well, as long as we can get the dump
contents to cumulate to a multiple of 1,000 (see below), they should all be
dumped in the same place. Suppose instead that on the third run we dump
apples beyond the location of the dump from the ﬁrst two runs. Then driving
that odd-lot of apples to a further location unnecessarily burns apples because
it subsequently forces the truck to leave the earlier apple dump with fewer
than 1,000 apples. So, not only must we dump the apples in only one location
on any given trip, but we must dump them at the same location on each trip.
So, where do we dump the apples on the three departures from City A, before
subsequently loading up from that combined dump and carrying them further
on? Well, if we dump them at the k-mile marker, we will end up with a total
12Dumping apples part-way into the journey is akin to the “depoting” of food and supplies that
took place during Antarctic journeys (Scott, 2008).

Answer 1.13,"I present three diﬀerent solutions: ﬁrst, an approximation that
draws upon the answer to the previous question; second, an exact algebraic
solution; and, third, an exact and slightly more elegant algebraic solution.
FIRST SOLUT ION
An approximate answer is a great place to start.16There are 360◦around the
clock face. The minute hand therefore travels at 6◦per minute. At 3:15 the
minute hand is 7 .5◦behind the hour hand (from the previous answer). To
travel that distance takes 7 .5/6 = 1 .25 minutes. That is, one minute and 15
seconds, or 75 seconds. So, at 3:16:15 the minute hand will arrive where the
hour hand was 75 seconds ago. Of course, the hour hand will have moved ever
so slightly during that 75 seconds. So, maybe you need to wait another, say,
ﬁve seconds until the two hands are perfectly coincident. That would be at
3:16:20. The exact solutions following are less than two seconds away from
this approximate answer.
SECOND SOLUT ION
The question asks the ﬁrst time after 3 pmwhen the hour and minute hands
of a clock are coincident. More generally, we can ask the ﬁrst time after npm
when the hour and minute hands are coincident, for n=1,2,. . . ,11 (we miss
out the 12 because the hands are not coincident after 12 and before 1).
Assume we start at npm,f o ro n eo f n=1,2,. . . ,11. By the time the minute
hand whips around to the non the dial, the hour hand will have moved slowly
on already. When the minute hand ﬁnally catches up with the hour hand, the
hour hand will have moved by a total of θ(n) degrees past the non the dial,
say. The minute hand whips around the dial 12 times faster than the hour
hand. So, while the hour hand covers θ(n) degrees, the minute hand covers
12·θ(n)d e g r e e s .
We can also state that the minute hand must have covered 30 n+θ(n)d e g r e e s .
That is 30 ndegrees to get around to the non the dial, and another θ(n)d e g r e e s
to ﬁnally catch the hour hand. So, we may write 30 n+θ(n)=1 2 ·θ(n), and
thus, θ(n)=3 0 n/11 degrees.17
15There are 2 πradians in a full circle. Thus, 360◦=2πradians; 180◦=πradians; 90◦=π
2
radians; and so on. It is just another way of measuring angles.
16I thank Eoin Healy for suggesting this approximation; any errors are mine.
17It also follows that θ(n)=n·θ(1) for n=1,2,. . . ,11, where θ(1) = 30/11 degrees.

Answer 1.14,"Well now, this looks pretty complicated the ﬁrst time you see it.
However, there is a simple way to ﬁgure it out. If you think about it, you see
that the only brokers who touch the switch for light bulb number 64 are those
whose numbers are divisors of 64.
That is, light bulb number 64 has its state of illumination changed by brokers
whose numbers are factors of 64. That is, brokers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64

Answer 1.16,"This is an old favorite. I have tried this out on people and have
received almost all imaginable responses. The answer is three, and it cannot
be anything else. Two socks can be diﬀerent, but a third must match one of
the ﬁrst two—giving a matching pair."
Answer 1.17,"With socks of Ndiﬀerent colors, you must pull ( N+1 ) s o c k s
from the drawer to be sure that you have a matching pair. The argument is
the same as it was for the previous question; Nsocks can be diﬀerent (the
worst-case scenario), but the ( N+1 )stsock must match one of the ﬁrst N
socks—giving a matching pair."
Answer 1.18,"Like the answer to the previous question, ask yourself ﬁrst what is
the worst-case scenario? That is, what is the maximum number of socks you
can select without obtaining the required three matching pairs? Recall that
the counts/colors are 2 red, 4 yellow, 6 purple, 8 brown, 10 white, 12 green,
14 black, 16 blue, 18 gray, and 20 orange socks. You will never be able to get
three-pair of the red or yellow socks because there are too few of them. There
are only eight candidate colors remaining. Thus, the worst-case scenario is
that you select 2 red, 4 yellow, and 5 of each of the remaining eight colors,
giving a total of 46 socks. As soon as you select a 47thsock, however, its color
must match the color of one of the previously selected quintuples in those eight
colors. Thus, you need at least 47 socks to guarantee a matching pair."
Answer 1.19,"You get the answer by working backwards. If I am your opponent,
and I am able to call out “39,” then you cannot reach 50, but I can after you
say whatever you say. So, my goal is to call out “39. ” However, if I am able
to call out “28,” then you cannot get to 39, but I can after you say whatever
you say. So, my goal is to call out “28. ” To get to 28, I need only to be able
to call out “17,” and to do this, I need only to be able to call out “6.”
So, my strategy, as your opponent, is to get onto the series 6, 17, 28, 39, 50 at
whichever point I can. If you get to go ﬁrst, you should call out “6.” As long
as you know the winning numbers and stick to them, you cannot lose. If you
start with anything other than 6, I cannot lose.

swer is that there are 40 possible numbers for the ﬁrst combination, 40 for the
second, and 40 for the third. It would then take at most 403possible trials
to get the safe open. That is 64,000 trials. There are two factors that reduce
this number considerably. The ﬁrst you should have ﬁgured out; the second
you are excused.
The ﬁrst factor is that although three numbers are required to open the safe,
you need only ﬁnd the ﬁrst two of them. If you dial the ﬁrst two numbers
correctly, then you need only turn the dial until the safe pops open. You do
not need to know the last number. This gives 402possible combinations. That
is only 1,600 trials. For extra safe-cracking advice along these lines see Gleick
(1993, pp. 189–190).18
The interviewer in this case suggested a second factor, as follows (and I think it
is a little unfair to any interviewee who is inexperienced in safe-cracking). The
safe is a mechanical device designed with a particular tolerance for inaccuracy.
If the ﬁrst combination number is 14, then dialing either 13, 14, or 15 suﬃces.
This tolerance for inaccuracy brings you down to roughly/p⎬renleft⎜ig
40
3/p⎬renright⎜ig2trials. This
is fewer than 200 trials.
One reader suggested that because you need only ﬁnd a sequence of numbers,
diﬀerent attempts could overlap with other attempts, to reduce the number of
trials needed. If you need to start again at zero every time, however, then this
approach fails. In practice, with real safes, you need to dial clockwise three
times past zero to 75, counter-clockwise two times past zero to 50, clockwise
once past zero to 25, or something like that. So, you need to start anew each
time."
Answer 1.21,"To minimize the maximum possible cost of weighing, your strategy
must use the scales as few times as possible, wherever the location of the “bad”
coin. From Answer 1.6, you know that you need three weighings to ﬁnd a bad
coin in a group of 12. You have 90 coins, so it must take at least four weighings.
However, by the same argument, if you had 144 coins (12 groups of 12), you
could identify a bad group of 12 in three weighings and then the bad coin in
another three. So, (because 90 is less than 144) it should take no more than
six weighings—either four, ﬁve, or six weighings.
In fact, it takes only ﬁve weighings (and at most $500) to both ﬁnd the bad
coin and identify it as heavy or light. I present two quite diﬀerent solution
techniques plus a third quasi-solution: the ﬁrst is an ingenious “hammer-
and-tongs” technique, the second is slightly more structured, and the third
generalizes the second but applies only in special cases. In each case, it takes
only ﬁve weighings to both ﬁnd the bad coin and identify it as heavy or light.

Answer 1.23,"After 100 seconds you can be sure that the ants have all walked
oﬀ the ruler. The answer is the same as if the ants had perfect vision. The
key is that if two ants who collide, immediately about face and continue, then
each member of any colliding pair eﬀectively exchanges its exit route with the
other; the ants are fungible. It is just as if one of the colliding pair crawled
over the other and they both kept going without pause.

Answer 1.24,"If you can ﬁgure out the correct relationship between the eight
lily pads and the single one, you get the answer. If you do not have it yet, or
you think it is 3.75 days, then you should stop reading now, and go back and
try again. I am serious; this is a nice question, and you lose a great deal by
peeking at the answers to help you out.
The naive answer is that it takes30
8=3.75 days. This is, of course, incorrect.
The lily pads in the question all grow at the same rate. This means that you
may think of the eight lily pads as being equivalent to one big lily pad. Indeed,
when the single lily pad is three days old, it has the same area as the eight
lily pads do at time zero. This means that you may think of the eight lily
pads as a single lily pad that is three days old. It takes another 27 days for a
three-day-old single lily pad to cover the pond, so it also takes 27 days for the
eight lily pads to cover the pond.
The interviewee suggested that I use 3,000 days instead of 30 days as the time
it takes for the single lily pad to cover the pond. The idea was to make the
question more confusing. The problem with this is that, no matter how small
the initial lily pad (assuming it is visible to the naked eye), it will cover the
surface of the Earth within 100 days and the entire solar system not long
after. Within 3,000 days, the universe will be blotted out—such is the power
of compound growth."
Answer 1.25,"You use the same idea as in the previous lily pad question. Each
pad needs to cover6,000
27square feet to choke the pond. The size of each
pad is 2Nafter Ndays, so you need to solve:6,000

Without a calculator, you can still do it in your head. You calculate6,000

Most people stumble a little. Do not memorize all the possible sixteenths

Add or subtract one-sixteenth to get the requested fraction into quarters or
eighths and then compensate for your adjustment.

Answer 1.27,"This is a common question. The naive answer is that the snail
climbs a net of two feet per day, so it reaches the 10-foot mark at the end of
the ﬁfth day. However, on the morning of the ﬁfth day, the snail starts out
at the eight-foot mark (having slid down from the nine-foot mark overnight).
Two-thirds of the way through the ﬁfth day, the snail reaches the 10-foot mark
and stops because there is no pole left to climb.

you can invite any three dead people (presumably resurrected), who would
you choose? Please do not choose any relatives.” Give it some thought."

1. Turn Switch #1 on. Wait a while. Then turn it oﬀ while simultaneously
turning Switch #2 on. Go into the room. The illuminated light corre-

Switch #1. The cold non-illuminated bulb corresponds to Switch #3.
2. Guess. You have a one-in-six chance if they are random. However, light
switches are not usually random. If you assume the switches are phys-
ically located in an order that relates to the physical placement of the

Answer 1.29,"The only way the ﬁrst man can know the color of his own hat is if
he sees the other two wearing red hats—of which there are only two. However,
the ﬁrst man does notknow his hat color, so the other two must be wearing
either both blue or one red and one blue. The second man, upon hearing the
ﬁrst, knows then that he and the third man are either both wearing blue hats,
or one wears a red hat, and one a blue. If he still does not know what color
hat he is wearing, it must be because the third man is wearing a blue hat.
Why? Well, if the third man wears red, then that pinpoints his own hat as
blue since this is the only option left from the choice of either both blue or
one red and one blue. Since the second man does not know his hat color, then
the third man must be wearing blue. The third man, upon hearing the ﬁrst
two, deduces that his own hat is blue via the same reasoning."
Answer 1.30,"You may be looking to the solutions for a hint. My ﬁrst hint is
that, if you are using linear algebra (i.e., solving systems of equations by sub-

Answer 1.31,"This is easier than it sounds. You do not need any inﬁnite sums,
and, if you used them, go back and try again before reading on. For every two
miles covered by the ﬁrst motorcyclist, the second covers three miles. Two plus
three is ﬁve, and there are ﬁve multiples of ﬁve between them. This means
they will meet after the ﬁrst has traveled 10 miles and the second 15. We
know that the ﬂy moves at twice the speed of the ﬁrst motorcyclist, so it must
cover 20 miles before its miserable life ends.
Many other solutions exist. Here is one I liked.31The second motorcyclist is

Answer 1.39,"First of all, “very small” is classic physics slang for very, very small
(i.e., so small that it is a pinpoint mass). If the rock is tossed overboard, the
water level falls as though water equal in mass to the mass of the rock is being
sucked out of the pool. The rock forces the boat to displace the rock’s mass
of water. After the rock is gone, the boat rises up, and the water level falls
down (Archimedes’ Principle).40
The next time you are washing dishes, try this experiment. With the sink
half-full of water, ﬂoat a drinking glass. Now drop a steel ball bearing gently
into the glass. The glass sinks down, displacing a mass of water equal in mass
to the mass of the ball bearing, and the water level rises. Now pluck the ball
bearing from the glass, using a magnet. The reverse happens, the glass rises,
and the water level falls as though water equal in mass to the mass of the ball
bearing is being sucked out of the sink.

Imagine the 20 ×20 chessboard in front of you, with the stacks of cubes on it as

cubes above the slice all lie in the southeast lower-triangular section below the

from southeast to northwest. They will ﬁll the lower stacks to a height of 20

Answer 1.51,"The numbers used and the situation described may diﬀer from
question to question, but the general solution technique is always the same.
Factor the product into all possible triplets: (1,2,18), (1,3,12), (1,4,9), (1,6,6),
(2,2,9), (2,3,6), and (3,3,4). Which one is it? Well, Mary knows the sum,
and these potential triplets sum to 21,16,14,13,13,11, and 10, respectively.
Knowing the sum was not suﬃcient for Mary to pin down the triplet, so it
must be a triplet with a non-unique sum: 13 in this case. This cuts down the
candidates to (1,6,6) and (2,2,9). John says the eldest is dyslexic, so there
must be an eldest (ignoring rubbish answers like one twin is 20 minutes older

Answer 1.54,"You win if you can place the last coin on the table and leave no
space for me to place a further coin. A necessary condition is that the table be
radially symmetric. That is, there must exist a central point on the table (at
its center of mass if the table is of uniform density and thickness) such that any
line drawn upon the table passing through this central point is evenly bisected
at this central point. Simple examples are a square, an ellipse, a rectangle, a
circular disc, etc.
You should play ﬁrst and place your ﬁrst quarter at the center of the table.
You should make subsequent moves by imitating me: Place your quarter in the
mirror image of my position when viewed looking through the central point.
This ensures victory because if I can still place a coin on the table, then so
can you.55
Although radial symmetry is necessary, it is not suﬃcient. The strategy does
not necessarily work if the table is a regular shape but not a simply-connected
one; for example, an annulus.56If the table is an annulus and the hole in the
middle is bigger than a quarter, then the only change to your winning strategy
is that you should let me go ﬁrst.
Story: A student of mine was asked “How would you value yourself?” That
is, put a dollar ﬁgure on your value using discounted cash ﬂow analysis."

55I thank Tim Hoel and Victor H. Lin for this elegant solution technique.
56An “annulus” is a disc with a hole in the center—like a musical compact disc, for example.
An annulus is path connected (any two points may be joined by a line), and is therefore connected
(it cannot be split into two non-empty non-intersecting open sets), but it is not simply connected
(which requires path-connectivity and that any loop may be shrunk continuously within the set).

Answer 1.56,"Deciphering the optimal strategy is analogous to locating an opti-
mal stock price exercise boundary for an American-style option. Calculating
the expected payoﬀ to the game, assuming the optimal strategy, is analogous
to valuing an American-style option. Like valuing an American option, you
have to work backward through a decision tree, calculating the expected pay-
oﬀs to proceeding versus stopping at each node. For two, four, six, and eight
cards, the expected payoﬀ to the game is $1

V(r, b) is the current accumulated score plus the additional expected value,
if any, remaining in the deck, assuming optimal play. With randbcards
remaining, denote this additional expected value as E(r, b). Thus, the value
of the game is V(r, b)=( R−r)−(B−b)+E(r, b). Simple logic dictates that
57An alternative solution has been suggested to me by Aidong Chen. Let each square on the
board be described by its coordinates ( x, y) for 1 ≤x, y≤8. Any domino covers two adjacent
squares, either ( x, y) and ( x, y+ 1), or ( x, y) and ( x+1,y). If we add those coordinates up, we
get 2 x+2y+ 1 in either case. To tile the 62 remaining squares requires 31 dominoes. If we add
up 31 coordinate sums, each of form 2 x+2y+ 1, we must get an odd number. If we add up the
coordinate sums of the 62 remaining squares, however, we must get an even number (because the
sum of the coordinate sums of all 64 squares is even by symmetry, and the two corners to subtract,
(1,1) and (8,8), have even sums). So, it cannot be done.

Your Perspective, No Rotations: Put your wristwatch on your left wrist

bearing arm is pointing the same direction as yours. Your wristwatch is to
the left of your head, and your reﬂected self’s wristwatch is also to your left
of his or her head. There has been no ﬂipping of left for right. Similarly, if
your head is pointing up, then your reﬂected self’s head is also pointing up,
andthere has been no ﬂipping of up for down.

Answer 1.72,"Let us use the standard high school physics equations for linear
motion with constant acceleration. There are, however, two good reasons for
having a sensible guess before doing any math. First, if our calculations give
an answer that is wildly diﬀerent from our guess, then we have some baseline
ﬁgure for suspecting we may have made an error in the math. Second, if you
start with a guess, it may be that your interviewer will hold up a hand and say
“OK, ﬁne, let’s move to the next question.” He or she may just have wanted
to get an estimate out of you to see if you can estimate anything. They may
not be interested at all in whether you remember simple equations of motion.
So, I would say “Well, I can estimate it using equations for linear motion with
constant acceleration, but ﬁrst let me guess that it is something like ...ﬁve
seconds and 100 miles per hour” (or whatever your guess is).
Now, if we have to go on to the math, I would tell the interviewer that these
equations of motion ignore air resistance, and any updraft caused by wind hit-
ting the building. The penny may in fact reach “terminal velocity” (i.e., when

Answer 1.77,"If you ask, your interviewer will conﬁrm that he or she expects an
exact solution and not some estimate, that you are allowed to ﬂip any coin if
you wish, and that the two piles need not have the same number of coins in
each. Now go back and try again before peeking any further.
You know the total number of heads in the 100 coins is equal to 10. So,
suppose you form one pile of Ncoins, and one pile of 100 −Ncoins. Let us
assume that there are Hheads and N−Htails in the ﬁrst pile (but you do
not know H).
Thus there are 10 −Hheads in the second pile and 90 −(N−H) tails in the
second pile. How can you get the number of heads in each pile to be the same?
Well, you cannot balance Hand 10 −Hbecause you don’t (and can’t) know
what His.
What do you know? You know you can ﬂip any coin. What if you ﬂipped
every coin in one pile? There is, after all, some sort of constrained symmetry
going on here. Let’s say you ﬂip every coin in the ﬁrst pile. Then you have
N−Hheads in the ﬁrst pile. Can you choose Nso that the number of heads
in each pile is the same in that case, that is, N−H=1 0 −H?Y e s , c l e a r l y
choosing N=1 0d o e st h ej o b .
So, all you have to do is split the coins into a pile of 10 coins and a pile of
90 coins, and then ﬂip every coin in the pile of 10 coins. If you had chosen
instead to ﬂip every coin in the second pile (i.e., the pile of 100 −Ncoins),
the algebra would have yielded exactly the same solution (you should check
that).
If you get mixed up in the interview, just plug some numbers in. For example,
suppose you start oﬀ with 3 heads and 7 tails, say, in the pile of 10 coins,
then you must have 7 heads and 83 tails in the pile of 90 coins. You can see
immediately that ﬂipping every coin in the pile of 10 coins will give 7 heads
in each pile.
In practice, of course, you don’t know how many heads are in each pile, just
that they are the same number. You might even end up with zero heads in
each pile if you happened to initially move all 10 heads into the pile of 10
coins.
If the interviewer had asked instead for the same number of tails in each pile,
you would form a pile of 10 coins and a pile of 90 coins, and ﬂip every coin in

FIRST SOLUT ION
Simulate pairs of random variables ( x, y), each distributed uniform on the

a unit square. A circle with unit diameter may be inscribed within the
unit square. I just need to count what proportion of points ( x, y)s a t i s f y

answer is generally accurate to within a tenth of a percentage point (i.e., ﬁrst
two decimal places correct).
SECOND SOLUT ION

Cutting oﬀ Equation A.20 at n=1 0,000 yields an approximation accurate to
three decimal places (i.e., 3.14169264359053). Cutting it oﬀ at n= 10,000,000
is accurate to six decimal places (i.e., 3.14159275358978). Convergence is a
little slow.
Note, however, that the partial sums in Leibniz’s approximation (like many
numerical techniques for pricing options) bounces up and down as nincreases,
alternately overestimating and then underestimating π/4. Like acceleration
techniques for pricing options, using the average of two successive estimates
will therefore improve accuracy (Crack, 2021). So, let B(N)=4 ·/summ⎬tiontextN

All the above assumes that the matrix be symmetric (if real-valued) or Her-

can, however, be generalized to non-symmetric and non-Hermitian matrices
(mathworld.wolfram.com ). In that case, the deﬁnition is applied only to the
symmetric part or Hermition part of the matrix, respectively.66
What about portfolio theory applications, theoretical and otherwise? In prac-
tice, portfolio optimization tools often assume that the VCV matrix is positive
deﬁnite (Kwan, 2010). For example, to obtain the standard Markowitz frontier
assuming short selling, you need that the variance-covariance (VCV) matrix
be invertible (Crack, 2020b). A positive deﬁnite matrix is invertible, but a
positive semi-deﬁnite matrix might have a zero eigenvalue, and therefore be
non-invertible.

Answer 1.81,"In practice, how do you test whether a square matrix is positive
deﬁnite? You cannot possibly test whether ⃗z′A⃗z>0,for all non-zero ⃗z′.S o ,
let us look at several techniques. Then we will discuss which one is computa-
tionally easiest without using pre-canned routines.
First, I would like to use Sylvester’s criterion , but we need to review
some terms. A sub-matrix obtained by deleting the ithrow and the jthcolumn
of an n×nmatrix is an ( n−1)×(n−1) matrix. The determinant of this
sub-matrix is called a minor (or, more fully, a minor determinant of order
n−1), and is sometimes denoted Mi,j.I f a n y t w o r o w s {i1,i2}and any two
columns {j1,j2}are deleted, then the determinant of the resulting sub-matrix
is a minor of order n−2, denoted Mi1,i2,j1,j2,a n ds oo n . I ft h en u m b e r i n g
of the deleted row(s) is identical to the numbering of the deleted column(s),
then the determinant of the resulting sub-matrix is a principal minor (of order
k,w h e r e n−krows and the same n−kcolumns have been deleted). The
determinants of the upper-left sub-matrices, in particular, are known as the
“leading principal minors” (Ayers, 1962).
So, for example, for a 5 ×5m a t r i x ,d e l e t i n gt h eﬁ r s tr o wa n dt h eﬁ f t hc o l u m n
produces a sub-matrix whose determinant, M1,5,i sam i n o r . I ti sn o t ,h o w e v e r ,
a principal minor, leading or otherwise. Deleting the second row and the sec-
ond column of the original matrix produces a sub-matrix whose determinant,
M2,2, is a principal minor, but it is not a leading principal minor. Finally,
deleting rows k:5a n dc o l u m n s k:5 ,f o ra n y k∈{2,3,4,5}produces a sub-
matrix whose determinant, Mk:5,k:5,i sal e a d i n gp r i n c i p a lm i n o r . ( N o t et h a t

Answer 1.82,"To identify local extrema of a function of two variables, we need

Answer 1.89,"You need only ask for a single piece of fruit to deduce the correct
labeling. If you are peeking here for a hint, then go back and ask yourself how
it can be done with only a single piece of fruit.
Given the symmetry of the problem, my initial instinct was that asking for
fruit from the barrel labeled “Apples,” or the one labeled “Oranges,” was not
going to solve the problem.
If you ask for a single piece of fruit from the barrel labeled “Apples and
Oranges,” then, given the mis-labeling, you know that every other piece of
fruit in that barrel is the same as the piece you requested. So, suppose you are
handed an apple from this barrel. Then, you have located the true “Apples”
barrel, currently labeled “Apples and Oranges. ” Given that you now know
where the true “Apples” barrel is, then you now know that the barrel labeled
“Oranges” cannot be the true “Apples” barrel. By construction, however, the
barrel labeled “Oranges” also cannot be the true “Oranges” barrel (because
every barrel is mis-labeled). Therefore, the barrel labeled “Oranges” must be
the true “Apples and Oranges” barrel (there is no other choice remaining).
Thus, we deduce that the remaining barrel, labeled “Apples,” must be the
true “Oranges” barrel.
Another way to think about the problem is that once you have identiﬁed that
the barrel labeled “Apples and Oranges” contains only apples, then you can
unpin the “Apples” label from its barrel, remove the “Apples and Oranges”
label, and pin the “Apples” label in its correct place. This leaves you with a
correctly labeled “Apples” barrel, an unlabeled barrel, an incorrectly labeled
“Oranges” barrel, and the “Apples and Oranges” label in your hand. You
know that the “Oranges” label has to move, and that the unlabeled barrel is
the only place to pin it. So, having done that, you can then pin the “Apples
and Oranges” label on the remaining barrel.
Of course, if at the initial step you are instead handed an orange from the
barrel labeled “Apples and Oranges,” then the argument is analogous (i.e., the

four zeroes after it. So, I will be looking at the leading digits of 115to see how

The number 11 has nice properties. For example, I know that 112= 121. In
fact, any number made just of ones, when squared, gives what I will call a
“podium” number. For example, 1 ,1112=1,234,321.

Given a ﬁnite list of prime numbers p1,p2,...,p N,l e tΠ= p1·p2···pNbe
their product. Consider (Π + 1); either (Π + 1) is a prime number or it is
not. If (Π + 1) is a prime number, then our ﬁnite list of prime numbers was
incomplete, for (Π+1) is yet another. If (Π+1) is not a prime number, then it
is a composite number (i.e., a non-prime number). All composite numbers are
divisible by a prime number (Euclid, 2008, Book 7, Proposition 31). Let this
prime divisor be p.T h e n pcannot be one of p1,p2,...,p N.F o r ,i f i t w e r e ,s a y ,
p=pi, then (Π + 1) would be divisible by pi,b u tΠ( b yi t sv e r yd e ﬁ n i t i o n )i s
also divisible by pi.I n t h i s c a s e ,i t f o l l o w s t h a t 1 = ( Π + 1 ) −Πi sa l s od i v i s i b l e
bypi, which is absurd. Thus our ﬁnite list of prime numbers was incomplete,
forpis yet another.
In other words, given any ﬁnite list of prime numbers, yet another prime
number can be found. So, there must be inﬁnitely many prime numbers.

Answer 1.96,"Following on from the answer to the previous question, let us use
factorials to construct a sequence of nconsecutive positive integers none of
which is prime.73Given positive integer n, without loss of generality, consider
the following nsuccessive numbers:
[(n+1 ) !+2 ] ,[(n+1 ) !+3 ] ,[(n+1 ) !+4 ] ,...,[(n+1 ) !+( n+1 ) ] .
The ﬁrst number is divisible by 2, the second number is divisible by 3, and so
on, up until the nthnumber which is divisible by ( n+1 ) . I tf o l l o w st h a tn o n e
of these nconsecutive numbers is prime, which was to be shown.
Note that the ﬁrstnumber at which a run of nsuccessive composite numbers
begins may be much lower than [( n+ 1)! + 2]. For example, when n=3 ,s u r e
enough [(3 + 1)! + 2] = (4! + 2) = 26, and 26, 27, 28 are consecutive composite
numbers, but so too are 8, 9, 10."
Answer 1.97,"Can the mean of two consecutive prime numbers be prime? No,
of course not. Replace the word “prime” with any other word, and the answer
is still no. If they are consecutive, then by deﬁnition there are none of them
in between!
73I thank Paul Bilokon for this proof; any errors are mine.
