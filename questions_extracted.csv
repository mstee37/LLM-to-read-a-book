Purely Quantitative & Logic
Questions
With a few exceptions, the only prerequisites for answering the questions in this
chapter are elementary quantitative skills and common sense. Some questions here
have both an elegant technique and a brute-force technique. The technique you
choose is revealing. Solutions for this chapter appear in Appendix A.
Question 1.1: /_387 You are given two glass jugs. Each contains the same volume,
V,o fl i q u i d . O n ej u gc o n t a i n sp u r ea l c o h o l ,a n dt h eo t h e rj u gc o n t a i n sp u r e
water. A modest quantity, Q,o fw a t e ri sp o u r e df r o mt h ew a t e rj u gi n t ot h e
alcohol jug, which is then thoroughly mixed. The same modest quantity, Q,
of (now diluted) alcohol is then poured back into the water jug to equalize the
volumes of the jugs at their initial levels.
The initial concentration of alcohol in the alcohol jug equals the initial concen-
tration of water in the water jug (at 100%). What is the relationship between
the ﬁnal concentrations of alcohol in the alcohol jug and water in the water
jug?1
Question 1.2: /_387 Fischer and Myron just stepped side-by-side onto a moving es-
calator. They are climbing up the stairs, and counting steps as they climb.
Myron is climbing more quickly than Fischer. Myron climbs three steps in
the time it takes Fischer to climb only two steps. Neither of them skips any
steps. Myron steps oﬀ at the top, having counted 25 steps. He waits at the
top for the slower Fischer, who steps oﬀ having counted only 20 steps. How
many steps are showing on the escalator at any instant?
Question 1.3: /_387 There are two bells. One rings ﬁve times per minute, and the
other rings four times per minute. If they start at the same time, how long
will it be until they next ring together?
1This is not a chemistry problem. Please ignore the fact that mixing a volume V1of water with
av o l u m e V2of alcohol results in a total volume less than V1+V2.F o l l o w - u pq u e s t i o n :R e p e a tt h e

Question 1.5: /_387 An old style analog clock falls oﬀ the wall and the face breaks into
three pieces. The numbers on each piece add to the same total. Describe the
pieces.
Question 1.6: /_387 (**) You are given a set of scales and 12 marbles. The scales are
of the old balance variety. That is, a small dish hangs from each end of a rod
that is balanced in the middle ( /_554). The device enables you to conclude either
that the contents of the dishes weigh the same or that the dish that falls lower
has heavier contents than the other.
The 12 marbles appear to be identical. In fact, 11 of them are identical, and
one is of a diﬀerent weight. Your task is to identify the unusual marble and
discard it. You are allowed to use the scales three times if you wish, but no
more. Note that the unusual marble may be heavier than the others, or it
may be lighter; you do not know which. You are asked to both identify it and
determine whether it is heavy or light.
Question 1.7: /_387 Suppose I inscribe a circle within a square so that the circle just
touches the four sides of the square. Suppose there is exactly enough room to
ﬁt a rectangle of dimensions 5 ×10 into one corner of the square so that the
rectangle just touches the circle. See Figure 1.1. What is the side length of
the square?
Question 1.8: /_387 Interviewer: “You are a bug sitting in one corner of a cubic room.
You wish to walk (no ﬂying) to the extreme opposite corner (the one farthest
from you). Describe the shortest path that you can walk. Be sure to mention
direction, length, and so on.”
Question 1.9: /_387 A mythical city contains 100,000 married couples but no children.
Each family wishes to “continue the male line,” but they do not wish to over-
populate. So, each family has one baby per annum until the arrival of the ﬁrst
boy. For example, if (at some future date) a family has ﬁve children, then it
must be either that they are all girls, and another child is planned, or that
there are four girls and one boy, and no more children are planned. Assume
that children are equally likely to be born male or female.
Letp(t)b et h ep e r c e n t a g eo f children that are male at the end of year t.H o w
is this percentage expected to evolve through time?

Figure 1.1: The Inscribed Circle Question
Note: A circle is inscribed within a square. A rectangle of dimen-
sions 5 ×10 just ﬁts in one corner. What is the side length Sof
the square?
Question 1.10: /_387 Picture a 10 ×10×10 “macro-cube” ﬂoating in mid-air. The
macro-cube is composed of 1 ×1×1 “micro-cubes,” all glued together. Weather
damage causes the outermost layer of micro-cubes to become loose. This
outermost layer falls to the ground. How many micro-cubes are on the ground?
Question 1.11: /_387 There are two cities, A and B, 1,000 miles apart. You have
3,000 apples at City A, and you want to deliver as many as possible of them
to City B. The only delivery method available is a truck. There are, however,
two problems. The truck can hold at most only 1,000 apples, and if there are
any apples at all in the truck, the hungry dishonest driver will steal and eat
one apple for every mile he drives. What is the maximum number of apples
you can deliver from City A to City B? Note that you are welcome to stop
part way, dump oﬀ some apples, and then come back and pick them up later.
Question 1.12: /_387 How many degrees (if any) are there in the angle between the
hour and minute hands of a clock when the time is a quarter past three?
Question 1.13: /_387 What is the ﬁrst time after 3 pmwhen the hour and minute hands
of a clock are exactly on top of each other?
Question 1.14: /_387 There are 100 light bulbs lined up in a row in a long room. Each
bulb has its own switch and is currently switched oﬀ. The room has an entry
door and an exit door. There are 100 stockbrokers lined up outside the entry

is numbered consecutively from 1 to 100.
Broker number 1 enters the room, switches on every bulb, and exits. Broker
number 2 enters and ﬂips the switch on every second bulb (turning oﬀ bulbs
2, 4, 6, ...). Broker number 3 enters and ﬂips the switch on every third bulb
(changing the state on bulbs 3, 6, 9, ...). This continues until all 100 brokers
have passed through the room.
What is the ﬁnal state of bulb number 64? Is it illuminated or dark?
Question 1.15: /_387 Exactly the same set-up as Question 1.14, with a diﬀerent ﬁnal
question: How many of the light bulbs are illuminated after the 100th person
has passed through the room, and which light bulbs are they?
Question 1.16: /_387 Your bedroom sock drawer contains eight red socks and 11 blue
socks that are otherwise identical. The light is broken in your bedroom, and
you must select your socks in the dark. What is the minimum number of socks
you need to take out of your drawer and carry into your (well-lit) living room
to guarantee that you have with you at least a matching pair to choose from?
Question 1.17: /_387 Following on from the previous question, can you generalize your
answer to otherwise-identical socks of Ndiﬀerent colors? For example, suppose
you have 50 socks of color 1, 50 socks of color 2, . . . , and 50 socks of color N,
how many socks must you pull from your sock drawer in the dark to guarantee
that you have a matching pair?
Question 1.18: /_387 Following on from the previous two questions, your bedroom
sock drawer contains 2 red, 4 yellow, 6 purple, 8 brown, 10 white, 12 green,
14 black, 16 blue, 18 gray, and 20 orange socks. It is dark, so you cannot
distinguish between the colors of the otherwise-identical socks. How many
socks do you need to take out of the drawer to guarantee that you have at
least three pairs of socks of the same color?
Story: One of my students was asked to “Describe the best boss you have
ever had. ” Watch out for the opposite question: “Describe the worst boss you
have ever had. ” Your answer may indicate disloyalty to a (former) employer.
Question 1.19: /_387 You and I are to play a competitive game. We shall take it in
turns to call out integers. The ﬁrst person to call out “50” wins. The rules
are as follows:
1. The player who starts must call out an integer between one and 10,
inclusive;
2. A new number called out must exceed the most recent number called by
at least one and by no more than 10. For example, if the ﬁrst player calls
out “nine,” then the range of valid numbers for the opponent is 10 to 19,
inclusive.

Do you want to go ﬁrst, and if so, what is your strategy?
Question 1.20: /_387 You are to open a safe without knowing the combination. Be-
ginning with the dial set at zero, the dial must be turned counter-clockwise to
the ﬁrst combination number, (then clockwise back to zero), and clockwise to
the second combination number, (then counter-clockwise back to zero), and
counter-clockwise again to the third and ﬁnal combination number, whereupon
the door shall immediately spring open; there is no handle or key to turn. The
dial has numbers from zero to 40, and the zero is not one of the combination
numbers.
Without knowing the combination numbers, what is the maximum number of
trials required to open the safe? One trial equals one attempt to dial a full
three-number combination, and you must start again from zero for each trial.
Story: 1. During the interview, an alarm clock went oﬀ from the candidate’s

Question 1.21: (**) You are given a set of scales and 90 coins (this question is
similar to Question 1.6). The scales are of the old balance variety. That is, a
small dish hangs from each end of a rod that is balanced in the middle. The
device enables you to conclude either that the contents of the dishes weigh
the same or that the dish that falls lower has heavier contents than the other.
You must pay $100 every time you use the scales.
The 90 coins appear to be identical. In fact, 89 of them are identical, and one
is of a diﬀerent weight. Your task is to identify the unusual coin and to discard
it while minimizing the maximum possible cost of weighing.3What is your
algorithm to complete this task? What is the most it can cost to identify the
unusual coin (assuming your strategy minimizes the maximum possible cost)?
Note that the unusual coin may be heavier than the others, or it may be
lighter. You are asked to both identify it and determine whether it is heavy
or light.4
Question 1.22: (***) Suppose that the function f(z) is complex valued in the
complex plane. Suppose also that f(z) is both bounded and entire. Prove

pected cost of weighing does not necessarily minimize the maximum possible cost. This is a subtle
distinction that you should not overlook.

light?

Story: A student of mine was taken to a room and asked to choose a place
to sit at a long oval-shaped table. He chose a place at random. Later the
interviewer asked why he had chosen that spot. I think the intent was to see
if he was a leader (sitting at the head) or a follower (sitting at the side).
Question 1.23: /_387 Ih a v ed r o p p e d1 0 , 0 0 0a n t sr a n d o m l yo n t oar u l e rt h a ti so n e
meter (i.e., 100 centimeters) long and oriented to point north–south. The
ants are of very small size and mass. Each ant walks at a steady pace of
one centimeter per second in a straight line parallel to the long edge of the
ruler. Their initial direction is randomly either north or south. The ants are
all from the same colony and possess an inherited vision problem: they have
peripheral vision only. This means that they can collide with each other if
they meet head on (although very small, they are large enough to collide). If
two ants do collide head on, however, then they each turn around instantly
and head back the way they came at their steady pace. With so many ants in
one small space, a single ant may experience multiple collisions before it walks
oﬀ of the ruler. So, how long must you wait to be sure that all the ants have
walked oﬀ of the ruler?
Question 1.24: /_387 You start with a single lily pad sitting on an otherwise empty
pond. You are told that the surface area of the lily pad doubles every day
and that it will take 30 days for the single lily pad to cover the surface of the
pond.6
If instead of one lily pad you start with eight lily pads (each identical in
characteristics to the original single lily pad), how many days will it take for
the surface of the pond to become covered?
Question 1.25: /_387 Another lily pad problem. There are 27 lily pads on a pond.
Each of the lily pads is one square foot in area. The pond is 6,000 square feet
in area. Each lily pad doubles its size every day. How long until the pond is
covered in lily pads?
Question 1.26: /_387 Interviewer: “Alright, you’re from MIT; you must be a quanti-
tative type of person. ” Interviewee: (conﬁdently, after a slight pause) “Yes
indeed. ” Interviewer: “Give me the decimal equivalent of13
16and of9
16.”
Question 1.27: /_387 A snail is climbing up a 10-foot pole. It climbs up by three feet
every day. Each night it sleeps. While sleeping, it slides down by one foot.
When does it reach the top of the pole?
5Recall that an “entire” function is a function that is analytic in the entire ﬁnite complex plane.

(Holland [1973, p. 5]).
6The student who was asked this question says that his interviewer used the number 30. However,
he suggested that I use the number 3,000 to make it more complicated. What is wrong with saying
that it takes 3,000 days for the lily pad to cover the pond?

Question 1.28: /_387 A windowless room contains three identical light ﬁxtures, each
containing an identical light bulb. Each light ﬁxture is connected to one of
three switches outside of the room. Each bulb is switched oﬀ at present. You
are outside the room, and the door is closed. You may ﬂip any of the external
switches in any manner you choose. After this, you must take your hands oﬀ
the switches and then you may go into the room and do as you please (but
you will not be allowed to damage anything or touch the switches again). How
can you tell which switch goes to which light?
Question 1.29: /_387 Inside of a dark closet are ﬁve hats: three blue and two red.
Three smart men go into the closet, and each selects a hat in the dark and
places it unseen upon his head. Each man knows both that the closet con-
tains three blue hats and two red and that the other two men have the same
knowledge.
Once outside the closet, no man can see his own hat. The ﬁrst man looks
at the other two, thinks, and says, “I cannot tell what color my hat is.” The
second man hears this, looks at the other two, and says, “I cannot tell what
color my hat is either. ” The third man is blind. The blind man says, “Well, I
know what color my hat is.” What color is his hat, and how does he know?
Question 1.30: (**) Find the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder
of 1 when divided by 2, a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, a remainder of 3
when divided by 4, ... and a remainder of 9 when divided by 10.
Question 1.31: /_387 There are two motorcyclists on a single lane road. They are 25
miles apart. At a signal, they start moving toward each other with constant
speeds. The ﬁrst motorcyclist rides at 20 mph; the second rides at 30 mph.
When the signal goes oﬀ, a ﬂy on the helmet of the ﬁrst motorcyclist is startled
and starts ﬂying toward the second motorcyclist at 40 mph. When the ﬂy
reaches the second motorcyclist (now moving toward the ﬁrst), he immediately
reverses course and ﬂies back to the ﬁrst motorcyclist. When the ﬂy gets back
to the ﬁrst motorcyclist, he reverses course again. The ﬂy continues to ﬂy
backwards and forwards between the two motorcyclists until they all collide.
How many miles will the ﬂy have traveled before his life is extinguished?

guest is given a numbered key for a speciﬁc room. Before they even go upstairs,
they are all invited to a large party in the banquet hall. To gain admittance
to the hall, they have to give up their keys to a doorman. At the end of the
evening, the guests are not sober enough to recall their room numbers, so the
doorman simply hands out the keys randomly. Each guest ends up spending
the night in a random room. What is the probability that at least one guest
ends up in the room to which he or she was originally assigned?
Question 1.35: /_387 At another party, everybody shakes hands with everybody else.
If there are 66 handshakes, how many people are at the party?
Question 1.36: There are 25 people at a party. What is the expected number of
pairs of people with the same birthday? For example, if John, Jon, Stephen,
and Mark all have the same birthday, say, January 15, but nobody else at the
party has a matching birthday, the count of pairs is six. (See also the next
two questions.)
Question 1.37: There are 25 people at another party. One person asks every-
body to announce their birthday, and for anyone who has the same birthday
as someone else to raise a hand. How many hands do you expect to see raised?
For example, if John, Jon, Stephen, and Mark all have the same birthday,
January 15, but nobody else at the party has a matching birthday, the count
of hands is four.

Question 1.40: (**) In a certain matriarchal town, the women all believe in an
old prophecy that says there will come a time when a stranger will visit the
town and announce whether any of the men folk are cheating on their wives.
The stranger will simply say “yes” or “no,” without announcing the number
of men implicated or their identities. If the stranger arrives and makes his
announcement, the women know that they must follow a particular rule: If
on any day following the stranger’s announcement a women deduces that her
husband is not faithful to her, she must kick him out into the street at 10 am
the next day. This action is immediately observable by every resident in the
town. It is well known that each wife is already observant enough to know
whether any man (except her own husband) is cheating on his wife. However,
no woman can reveal that information to any other. A cheating husband is
also assumed to remain silent about his inﬁdelity.
The time comes, and a stranger arrives. He announces that there are cheating
men in the town. On the morning of the tenth day following the stranger’s
arrival, some unfaithful men are kicked out into the street for the ﬁrst time.
How many of them are there?

over the edge of the board and without any of them overlapping? You must
not damage the board or the dominoes in the process or do anything weird
like standing them on their ends—just answer the question.10
9Similarly, you could see questions on integrals (or derivatives) of sin θ, cos θ, tan θ, cot θ, and
cosec θ.
10Naoki Sato has suggested a follow-up question. Place an “X” on two squares: one black, and
one white. Can you cover the remaining squares with dominoes? See Answer 1.55 for the solution.

71,"Question 1.56: (***) You have 52 playing cards (26 red, 26 black). You draw
cards one by one. A red card pays you a dollar. A black one ﬁnes you a
dollar. You can stop any time you want. Cards are not returned to the deck
after being drawn. What is the optimal stopping rule in terms of maximizing
expected payoﬀ? Also, what is the expected payoﬀ following this optimal
rule?11
Question 1.57: One of my students interviewed with some folks who “wanted to
get an idea of his comfort with formulae and with explaining things to clients. ”
They asked why it is that if pis a prime number greater than 3, then p2−1
is always divisible by 24 with no remainder.
Question 1.58: You are bidding Bfor a ﬁrm whose unknown true value is uni-
formly distributed between 0 and 1. Although you do not know the true value

Question 1.59: /_387 You have a string-like fuse that burns in exactly one minute.
The fuse is inhomogeneous, and it may burn slowly at ﬁrst, then quickly, then
slowly, and so on. You have a match, and no watch. How do you measure
exactly 30 seconds?
Question 1.60: /_387 You have two string-like fuses. Each burns in exactly one minute.
The fuses are inhomogeneous, and may burn slowly at ﬁrst, then quickly, then
slowly, and so on. You have a match, and no watch. How do you measure
exactly 45 seconds?
Question 1.61: /_387 How many places are there on the Earth where you can walk
one mile south, one mile east, one mile north, and end up exactly where you
started? Assume the Earth is a perfect sphere, that your compass bearing is
constant on each leg of the walk, that all parts of the Earth are able to be
walked upon, and that your feet are arbitrarily small.
Question 1.62: /_387 This is an absolute classic. A king demands a tax of 1,000 gold
sovereigns from each of 10 regions of his nation. The tax collectors for each
region bring him the requested bag of gold coins at year end. An informant
tells the king that one tax collector is cheating and giving coins that are
consistently 10% lighter than they should be, but he does not know which
collector is cheating. The king knows that each coin should weigh exactly one
ounce. How can the king identify the cheat by using a weighing device exactly
once? (I have seen the same question asked with 10 pill bottles, nine of which
have pills weighing 10g, but one of which has pills weighing 9g, and your task
is to identify the bottle of light pills by using a weighing device exactly once.)
11Try the same question with four cards (two red, two black).

Question 1.64: /_387 Again, an absolute classic. You hire a man to work in your yard
for seven days. You wish to pay him in gold. You have one gold bar with
seven parts—like a chocolate bar. You wish to pay him one gold part per day,
but you may snap the bar in only two places. Where do you snap the bar so
that you may pay him at the end of each day, and so that on successive days
he may use what you paid him previously to make change?

head.
Question 1.67: (**) I am told this is a genuine ﬁnance interview question. It
had to be a trading interview, because no one but a trader would ask this
in an interview. I considered transforming the question, but left it as is for
authenticity. Avert your eyes if you are easily oﬀended!
How can three men and one woman have mutually safe heterosexual inter-

Question 1.68: Consider a grid. You start at coordinate (0 ,0) and move one
step at a time, eventually arriving at coordinate (5 ,5). With each step you
may move only one step east or one step north but never diagonally. How
many paths are there from (0 ,0) to (5 ,5)?
Question 1.69: /_387 Six friends go out to lunch. The bill is $132.67. They decide to

Question 1.70:/_387You walk into a pizza shop. They sell three sizes of pizza: small,
medium, and large. All are perfectly circular, have the same thickness, and
have the same density of toppings. The price of a large pizza is equal to the
price of a medium pizza plus the price of a small pizza: PL=PM+PS. You
see a group of your friends already sitting in the pizza store and they have just
had one of each size pizza delivered to their table plus they have been given
one empty box to take any leftovers home in. Each of their pizzas has been
pre-cut into (perfect) sixths. Their box is a (perfect) square. You are looking

told that there are 10 heads and 90 tails turned up. Unfortunately, the room
is pitch black (or you are blindfolded) and you cannot see the quarters. You
also cannot tell by touch which way up they are. So, how can you divide them

is marked out to look like the dial of an analog clock. The host is sitting at
12 o’clock, and 11 guests are sitting at each hour from 1 o’clock to 11 o’clock,
respectively. (In fact, the original question did not mention a clock, but I
think it makes for a clear mental image.) The host holds a prize. He will
pass the prize to someone seated next to him. Then that person will pass it
to someone seated next to him, and so on. The host, or any guest, is equally
likely to pass the prize clockwise or counter-clockwise. The last guest to touch
the prize wins it. (That is, the 11th guest to lay hands upon the prize gets to
keep it.) Which hour of the clock should you sit at to have the highest chance
of winning the prize?

you want from any of the labeled barrels. What is the minimum number of

You are going to write a single-digit number on each face of each die so that
you can display the two dice together on your desk to represent days of the
month. You must use both dice. For example, (0 ,3) is the third of the month,
(1,0) is the tenth of the month, (1 ,9) is the nineteenth of the month, and
(3,1) is the thirty-ﬁrst of the month. You can swap the order of the physical
dice if you need to (e.g., maybe you only want a 0 on one die, so that you can
use it ﬁrst during the ﬁrst nine days of the month, but use it second on the
tenth day of the month). What numbers do you put on each die?
