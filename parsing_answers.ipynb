       "'Appendix D\\nStatistics Answers\\nThis appendix contains answers to the questions posed in Chapter 4.\\nAnswer 4.1: Before giving an algebraic answer, I think you should have a guess.\\nThis shows that you can guess, and it gives you a baseline number to compare\\nyour algebraic answer with, which could produce a warning red ﬂag if you\\nmake a mistake with the algebra.\\nObviously, when you buy your ﬁrst cereal box, you get one of the four toys\\nwith probability one on that draw. As you acquire diﬀerent toys, however, the\\nlikelihood that you get the next one in only one draw falls. For example, by\\nthe time you already have three of the four toys, you only have one chance in\\nfour that the next draw will give you the fourth. So, the absolute minimum\\nnumber of purchases required is four, but you could buy 100 boxes, and not\\nget all four toys—though this latter outcome seems very unlikely. Weighing\\nthese odds up, my gut instinct is that it should take something like 10 draws\\non average to get all four toys.\\nNow let us solve the problem algebraically. Consider ﬁrst the more general\\nproblem of having Ttoys. (As an aside, note that the answer we seek must\\nalso be the same as if we roll a T-sided die and we ask how many rolls do we\\nexpect to have to make in order to have seen all Tsides appear.)\\nLet us give a simple recursion argument. Suppose that Tis the number of\\ndiﬀerent toys we seek. Let us suppose that we are currently attempting to\\nget our tthtoy, having already found ( t−1) diﬀerent toys. We can immedi-\\nately see that the probability, ptthat we get the tthtoy in only one draw is\\n[T−(t−1)]/T. For example, when seeking the ﬁrst toy, p1=1 ,a n dw h e n\\nseeking the second toy, p2=(T−1)/T,a n ds oo n .\\nLetNtbe the number of draws required to obtain the tthtoy, having already\\nfound ( t−1) diﬀerent toys. Then there is probability ptthat we get the tth\\ntoy in one draw, and probability (1 −pt)t h a tw eh a v et od r a wa g a i n . G i v e n\\nindependence of outcomes on diﬀerent draws, it follows that we have a simple\\nrecursion for E(Nt)g i v e nb y\\nE(Nt)=pt·1+( 1 −pt)·[1 +E(Nt)].\\n©2021 Timothy Falcon Crack 287 All Rights Reserved Worldwide'"
